It is designed to be both extensible and simple to use, complementing existing CRN-related tools. CoNtRol currently implements a number of necessary and/or sufficient structural tests for multiple equilibria, stable periodic orbits, convergence to equilibria and persistence, with the potential for incorporation of further tests.Availability and implementation: Reference implementation: reaction-networks.net/control/.

To what extent was this loss the result of organizational factors at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration? To discuss this question analytically, we need a theory of organizational reliability and agency behavior. Martin Landau's work on redundancy and administrative performance provides a good starting point for such an effort. Expanding on Landau's work, I formulate a more comprehensive theory of organizational reliability that incorporates both type I and type II errors. These principles are then applied in a study of NASA and its administrative behavior before and after the Challenger accident.},

	abstract = {An overview of a comprehensive framework is given for estimating the predictive uncertainty of scientiﬁc computing applications. The framework is comprehensive in the sense that it treats both types of uncertainty (aleatory and epistemic), incorporates uncertainty due to the mathematical form of the model, and it provides a procedure for including estimates of numerical error in the predictive uncertainty. Aleatory (random) uncertainties in model inputs are treated as random variables, while epistemic (lack of knowledge) uncertainties are treated as intervals with no assumed probability distributions. Approaches for propagating both types of uncertainties through the model to the system response quantities of interest are brieﬂy discussed. Numerical approximation errors (due to discretization, iteration, and computer round off) are estimated using veriﬁcation techniques, and the conversion of these errors into epistemic uncertainties is discussed. Model form uncertainty is quantiﬁed using (a) model validation procedures, i.e., statistical comparisons of model predictions to available experimental data, and (b) extrapolation of this uncertainty structure to points in the application domain where experimental data do not exist. Finally, methods for conveying the total predictive uncertainty to decision makers are presented. The different steps in the predictive uncertainty framework are illustrated using a simple example in computational ﬂuid dynamics applied to a hypersonic wind tunnel.},

Text-based model definition languages allow researchers to create models simply, and then export them to a common exchange format. Modular languages allow researchers to create and combine complex models more easily. We saw a use for a modular text-based language, together with a translation library to allow other programs to read the models as well., Summary: The Antimony language provides a way for a researcher to use simple text statements to create, import, and combine biological models, allowing complex models to be built from simpler models, and provides a special syntax for the creation of modular genetic networks. The libAntimony library allows other software packages to import these models and convert them either to SBML or their own internal format., Availability: The Antimony language specification and the libAntimony library are available under a BSD license from http://antimony.sourceforge.net/, Contact: lpsmith@u.washington.edu},

	abstract = {An artificial intelligence based on a genetic algorithm to build chemical reaction network (CRN) from chemical species concentration data from batch reaction is introduced. This is achieved through a two level optimization approach. The first level constructs the CRN through combinations of stoichiometric coefficients of all chemical species and optimized using genetic algorithm. Second level determines the best estimate for the reaction rate constants for each of the reactions using a standard non-linear optimization algorithm. The process is repeated through a number of generations where the genetic algorithm will successively reduce the number of possibilities through elimination of poor CRNs (based on how closely the CRN is able to predict concentration profiles) and retaining and re-optimizing better CRNs. This system’s capability is demonstrated on an experimental data for the reaction between trimethyl orthoacetate and allyl alcohol. The results show that the system is able to develop a CRN that when simulated provides an accurate model (model predictions matching experimental measurements) with little human intervention.},

	abstract = {Several computational models of chemical reaction networks have been presented in the literature in the past, showing the appearance and (potential) evolution of autocatalytic sets. However, the notion of autocatalytic sets has been defined differently in different modeling contexts, each one having some shortcoming or limitation. Here, we review four such models and definitions, and then formally describe and analyze them in the context of a mathematical framework for studying autocatalytic sets known as RAF theory. The main results are that: (1) RAF theory can capture the various previous definitions of autocatalytic sets and is therefore more complete and general, (2) the formal framework can be used to efficiently detect and analyze autocatalytic sets in all of these different computational models, (3) autocatalytic (RAF) sets are indeed likely to appear and evolve in such models, and (4) this could have important implications for a possible metabolism-first scenario for the origin of life.},

	abstract = {We present an approach to reconstructing chemical reaction networks from time series measurements of the concentrations of the molecules involved. Our solution strategy combines techniques from numerical sensitivity analysis and probabilistic graphical models. By modeling a chemical reaction system as a Markov network (undirected graphical model), we show how systematically probing for sensitivities between molecular species can identify the topology of the network. Given the topology, our approach next uses detailed sensitivity proﬁles to characterize properties of reactions such as reversibility, enzyme-catalysis, and the precise stoichiometries of the reactants and products. We demonstrate applications to reconstructing key biological systems including the yeast cell cycle. In addition to network reconstruction, our algorithm ﬁnds applications in model reduction and model comprehension. We argue that our reconstruction algorithm can serve as an important primitive for data mining in systems biology applications.},

	title = {Identifying frequent patterns in biochemical reaction networks: a workflow},
	volume = {2018},
	abstract = {Computational models in biology encode molecular and cell biological processes. Many of these models can be represented as biochemical reaction networks. Studying such networks, one is mostly interested in systems that share similar reactions and mechanisms. Typical goals of an investigation thus include understanding of model parts, identiﬁcation of reoccurring patterns and recognition of biologically relevant motifs. The large number and size of available models, however, require automated methods to support researchers in achieving their goals. Speciﬁcally for the problem of ﬁnding patterns in large networks only partial solutions exist. We propose a workﬂow that identiﬁes frequent structural patterns in biochemical reaction networks encoded in the Systems Biology Markup Language. The workﬂow utilizes a subgraph mining algorithm to detect the network patterns. Once patterns are identiﬁed, the textual pattern description can automatically be converted into a graphical representation. Furthermore, information about the distribution of patterns among a selected set of models can be retrieved. The workﬂow was validated with 575 models from the curated branch of BioModels. In this paper, we highlight interesting and frequent structural patterns. Furthermore, we provide exemplary patterns that incorporate terms from the Systems Biology Ontology. Our workﬂow can be applied to a custom set of models or to models already existing in our graph database MaSyMoS. The occurrences of frequent patterns may give insight into the encoding of central biological processes, evaluate postulated biological motifs or serve as a similarity measure for models that share common structures.},

Model credibility is the willingness of people to trust a model's predictions and is often difficult to establish for computational biology models. A 3 × 3 matrix has been proposed to allow such models to be categorised with respect to their testability and epistemic foundation in order to guide the selection of an appropriate process of validation to supply evidence to establish credibility. Three approaches to validation are identified that can be deployed depending on whether a model is deemed untestable, testable or lies somewhere in between. In the latter two cases, the validation process involves the quantification of uncertainty which is a key output. The issues arising due to the complexity and inherent variability of biological systems are discussed and the creation of 'digital twins' proposed as a means to alleviate the issues and provide a more robust, transparent and traceable route to model credibility and acceptance.},

	abstract = {Biological systems are typically composed of highly interconnected subunits and possess an inherent complexity that make monitoring, control and optimization of a bioprocess a challenging task. Today a toolset of modeling techniques can provide guidance in understanding complexity and in meeting those challenges. Over the last four decades, computational performance increased exponentially. This increase in hardware capacity allowed ever more detailed and computationally intensive models approaching a “one-to-one” representation of the biological reality. Fueled by governmental guidelines like the PAT initiative of the FDA, novel soft sensors and techniques were developed in the past to ensure product quality and provide data in real time. The estimation of current process state and prediction of future process course eventually enabled dynamic process control. In this review, past, present and envisioned future of models in biotechnology are compared and discussed with regard to application in process monitoring, control and optimization. In addition, hardware requirements and availability to fit the needs of increasingly more complex models are summarized. The major techniques and diverse approaches of modeling in industrial biotechnology are compared, and current as well as future trends and perspectives are outlined.},

It is not yet directly applicable to the problems of patients with brain disease. To be used for clinical applications, there must not only be considerable progress in the field but also a concerted effort to use best practices in order to demonstrate model credibility to regulatory bodies, to clinics and hospitals, to doctors, and to patients. In doing this for neuroscience, we can learn lessons from long-standing practices in other areas of simulation (aircraft, computer chips), from software engineering, and from other biomedical disciplines. In this manuscript, we introduce some basic concepts that will be important in the development of credible clinical neuroscience models: reproducibility and replicability; verification and validation; model configuration; and procedures and processes for credible mechanistic multiscale modeling. We also discuss how garnering strong community involvement can promote model credibility. Finally, in addition to direct usage with patients, we note the potential for simulation usage in the area of Simulation-Based Medical Education, an area which to date has been primarily reliant on physical models (mannequins) and scenario-based simulations rather than on numerical simulations.},

Preclinical models of disease and therapy, largely conducted in rodents, have known deficiencies in replicating most human conditions. Their translation to human results is acknowledged to be poor for decades. Clinical data quality and quantity is also recognized as deficient; gold standard randomized clinical trials are expensive. Few solid conclusions from clinical studies are replicable and many remain unpublished. The translational pathway from fundamental biomedical research through to innovative solutions handed to clinical practitioners is therefore highly inefficient and costly in terms of wasted resources, early claims from fundamental discoveries never witnessed in humans, and few new, improved solutions available clinically for myriad diseases. Improving this biomedical research strategy and resourcing for reliability, translational relevance, reproducibility and clinical impact requires careful analysis and consistent enforcement at both funding and peer review levels.},

	abstract = {The complexities of modern biomedicine are rapidly increasing. Thus, modeling and simulation have become increasingly important as a strategy to understand and predict the trajectory of pathophysiology, disease genesis, and disease spread in support of clinical and policy decisions. In such cases, inappropriate or ill-placed trust in the model and simulation outcomes may result in negative outcomes, and hence illustrate the need to formalize the execution and communication of modeling and simulation practices. Although verification and validation have been generally accepted as significant components of a model’s credibility, they cannot be assumed to equate to a holistic credible practice, which includes activities that can impact comprehension and in-depth examination inherent in the development and reuse of the models. For the past several years, the Committee on Credible Practice of Modeling and Simulation in Healthcare, an interdisciplinary group seeded from a U.S. interagency initiative, has worked to codify best practices. Here, we provide Ten Rules for credible practice of modeling and simulation in healthcare developed from a comparative analysis by the Committee’s multidisciplinary membership, followed by a large stakeholder community survey. These rules establish a unified conceptual framework for modeling and simulation design, implementation, evaluation, dissemination and usage across the modeling and simulation life-cycle. While biomedical science and clinical care domains have somewhat different requirements and expectations for credible practice, our study converged on rules that would be useful across a broad swath of model types. In brief, the rules are: (1) Define context clearly. (2) Use contextually appropriate data. (3) Evaluate within context. (4) List limitations explicitly. (5) Use version control. (6) Document appropriately. (7) Disseminate broadly. (8) Get independent reviews. (9) Test competing implementations. (10) Conform to standards. Although some of these are common sense guidelines, we have found that many are often missed or misconstrued, even by seasoned practitioners. Computational models are already widely used in basic science to generate new biomedical knowledge. As they penetrate clinical care and healthcare policy, contributing to personalized and precision medicine, clinical safety will require established guidelines for the credible practice of modeling and simulation in healthcare.},

	abstract = {The increasing reliance of modern science in computer simulation demands appropriate trust in simulation models for credible results. Because of its foundations in operations research, model credibility is conventionally viewed from the lens of numerical and transformational accuracy. However, the exploratory use of models in scientific discovery, causal explanation, and strategic decision-making render this view incomplete. Recognising the significance of the cognitive interests of model users and the context-sensitive, adaptive nature of building confidence in scientific models, we characterise credibility as trust. Appropriate and justifiable trust is conceptualised as a dynamic, cognitive construct that evolves through interactive, experiential learning. Following the delineation of the dimensions and attributes of trust, conceptual foundations of a dynamic trust model, including alternative measurement strate­ gies, are proposed. Guidelines for trustable models are elaborated to provide a basis for exploiting synergies between the cognitive models of trust and model evaluation.},

In areas in which models affect real-world decision-making, including within the clinic, in regulatory science, or in the design and engineering of novel therapeutics, this question is of critical importance. Without an answer, it impairs the usefulness of models and casts a shadow over model credibility in all domains. To address this question, we examine the use of nonmathematical models in physiological research, in medical practice, and in engineering to see how models in other domains are used and accepted. We reflect on historic physiological models and how they have been presented to the scientific community.

Some regulatory agencies recently started to consider evidences of safety and efficacy on new medical products obtained using computer modelling and simulation (which is referred to as In Silico Trials); this has raised the attention in the computational medicine research community on the regulatory science aspects of this emerging discipline. But this poses a foundational problem: in the domain of biomedical research the use of computer modelling is relatively recent, without a widely accepted epistemic framing for model credibility. Also, because of the inherent complexity of living organisms, biomedical modellers tend to use a variety of modelling methods, sometimes mixing them in the solution of a single problem. In such context merely adopting credibility approaches developed within other research communities might not be appropriate. In this paper we propose a theoretical framing for assessing the credibility of a predictive models for In Silico Trials, which accounts for the epistemic specificity of this research field and is general enough to be used for different type of models.},

This endeavor demands close collaboration and communication between modeler and experimenter, which can be facilitated by standards concerning workflows and data formats. We have conducted a survey to find out what the community thinks about the requirements and benefits of standardization efforts; we also evaluated which modeling methods and software tools are being used in the systems biology community. Free availability and flexibility are the top criteria that govern the choice of software tools. SBML is widely recognized as a standard format for systems biology models. Eighty percent of the 125 respondents favor standardization, but there is also consensus that standards should not be enforced at all costs. The most significant demands are standardized formats for experimental data and mathematical models, standardized names for metabolites, reactions and enzymes, and standardized graphical representation of networks.},

	abstract = {Objective: Like all scientific research, computational neuroscience research must be reproducible. Big data science, including simulation research, cannot depend exclusively on journal articles as the method to provide the sharing and transparency required for reproducibility. Methods: Ensuring model reproducibility requires the use of multiple standard software practices and tools, including version control, strong commenting and documentation, and code modularity. Results: Building on these standard practices, model-sharing sites and tools have been developed that fit into several categories: 1) standardized neural simulators; 2) shared computational resources; 3) declarative model descriptors, ontologies, and standardized annotations; and 4) model-sharing repositories and sharing standards. Conclusion: A number of complementary innovations have been proposed to enhance sharing, transparency, and reproducibility. The individual user can be encouraged to make use of version control, commenting, documentation, and modularity in development of models. The community can help by requiring model sharing as a condition of publication and funding. Significance: Model management will become increasingly important as multiscale models become larger, more detailed, and correspondingly more difficult to manage by any single investigator or single laboratory. Additional big data management complexity will come as the models become more useful in interpreting experiments, thus increasing the need to ensure clear alignment between modeling data, both parameters and results, and experiment.},

There are a variety of reasons for this. One of the most likely reasons is that given how busy modern researchers are and the fact that no credit is given to authors for publishing repeatable work, it is inevitable that this will be the case. The situation can only be rectified when government agencies, universities and other research institutions change policies and that journals begin to insist that published work is in fact at least repeatable if not reproducible. In this chapter guidelines are described that can be used by researchers to help make sure their work is repeatable. A scoring system is suggested that authors can use to determine how well they are doing.},

The best practices emphasize the benefits obtained by using standard tools and formats and provides guidance to modelers who do not or cannot use standards in some stages of their modeling workflow.

BioPAX can represent metabolic and signaling pathways, molecular and genetic interactions and gene regulation networks. BioPAX was created through a community process.

	abstract = {Background
With the ever increasing use of computational models in the biosciences, the need to share models and reproduce the results of published studies efficiently and easily is becoming more important. To this end, various standards have been proposed that can be used to describe models, simulations, data or other essential information in a consistent fashion. These constitute various separate components required to reproduce a given published scientific result.

Results
We describe the Open Modeling EXchange format (OMEX). Together with the use of other standard formats from the Computational Modeling in Biology Network (COMBINE), OMEX is the basis of the COMBINE Archive, a single file that supports the exchange of all the information necessary for a modeling and simulation experiment in biology. An OMEX file is a ZIP container that includes a manifest file, listing the content of the archive, an optional metadata file adding information about the archive and its content, and the files describing the model. The content of a COMBINE Archive consists of files encoded in COMBINE standards whenever possible, but may include additional files defined by an Internet Media Type. Several tools that support the COMBINE Archive are available, either as independent libraries or embedded in modeling software.

Conclusions
The COMBINE Archive facilitates the reproduction of modeling and simulation experiments in biology by embedding all the relevant information in one file. Having all the information stored and exchanged at once also helps in building activity logs and audit trails. We anticipate that the COMBINE Archive will become a significant help for modellers, as the domain moves to larger, more complex experiments such as multi-scale models of organs, digital organisms, and bioengineering.

	abstract = {The reproduciblity of scientiﬁc research is crucial to the success of the scientiﬁc method. Here we review the current best practices when publishing mechanistic models in systems biology. We recommend, where possible, to use software engineering strategies such as testing, veriﬁcation, validation, documentation, versioning, iterative development, and continuous integration. In addition, adhering to the FAIR modeling principles allows other scientists to collaborate and build oﬀ of each other’s work. Existing standards such as SBML, CellML, or SED-ML can greatly improve the likelihood that a published model is reproducible, especially since such models will be deposited in well-established model repositories. Where models are published in executable programming languages, the source code and their data should be published as open-source in public code repositories together with any documentation and testing code. For complex models we recommend container based solutions where any software dependencies and the run-time context can be easily replicated.},

Efforts such as SBML or CellML standardize the formal representation of computational models in various areas of biology.

These standards, together with further COMBINE standards, describe models sufficiently well for the reproduction of simulation studies among users and software tools. The Simulation Experiment Description Markup Language (SED-ML) is an XML-based format that encodes, for a given simulation experiment, (i) which models to use; (ii) which modifications to apply to models before simulation; (iii) which simulation procedures to run on each model; (iv) how to post-process the data; and (v) how these results should be plotted and reported. SED-ML Level 1 Version 1 (L1V1) implemented support for the encoding of basic time course simulations. SED-ML L1V2 added support for more complex types of simulations, specifically repeated tasks and chained simulation procedures. SED-ML L1V3 extends L1V2 by means to describe which datasets and subsets thereof to use within a simulation experiment.},

Model simulation exchange has been standardized with the Simulation Experiment Description Markup Language (SED-ML), but specialized software is needed to generate simulations in this format. Text-based languages allow researchers to create and modify experimental protocols quickly and easily, and export them to a common machine-readable format.

Results
phraSED-ML language allows modelers to use simple text commands to encode various elements of SED-ML (models, tasks, simulations, and results) in a format easy to read and modify. The library can translate this script to SED-ML for use in other softwares.

	abstract = {Motivation: The biological pathway exchange language (BioPAX) and the systems biology markup language (SBML) belong to the most popular modeling and data exchange languages in systems biology. The focus of SBML is quantitative modeling and dynamic simulation of models, whereas the BioPAX specification concentrates mainly on visualization and qualitative analysis of pathway maps. BioPAX describes reactions and relations. In contrast, SBML core exclusively describes quantitative processes such as reactions. With the SBML qualitative models extension (qual), it has recently also become possible to describe relations in SBML. Before the development of SBML qual, relations could not be properly translated into SBML. Until now, there exists no BioPAX to SBML converter that is fully capable of translating both reactions and relations., Results: The entire nature pathway interaction database has been converted from BioPAX (Level 2 and Level 3) into SBML (Level 3 Version 1) including both reactions and relations by using the new qual extension package. Additionally, we present the new webtool BioPAX2SBML for further BioPAX to SBML conversions. Compared with previous conversion tools, BioPAX2SBML is more comprehensive, more robust and more exact., Availability: BioPAX2SBML is freely available at http://webservices.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/ and the complete collection of the PID models is available at http://www.cogsys.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/downloads/Qualitative-Models/., Contact:

To provide a platform to support universal sharing, easy accessibility and model reproducibility, BioModels (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/), a repository for mathematical models, was established in 2005. The current BioModels platform allows submission of models encoded in diverse modelling formats, including SBML, CellML, PharmML, COMBINE archive, MATLAB, Mathematica, R, Python or C++. The models submitted to BioModels are curated to verify the computational representation of the biological process and the reproducibility of the simulation results in the reference publication. The curation also involves encoding models in standard formats and annotation with controlled vocabularies following MIRIAM (minimal information required in the annotation of biochemical models) guidelines. BioModels now accepts large-scale submission of auto-generated computational models. With gradual growth in content over 15 years, BioModels currently hosts about 2000 models from the published literature. With about 800 curated models, BioModels has become the world’s largest repository of curated models and emerged as the third most used data resource after PubMed and Google Scholar among the scientists who use modelling in their research. Thus, BioModels benefits modellers by providing access to reliable and semantically enriched curated models in standard formats that are easy to share, reproduce and reuse.}",

  author   = "Olivier, Brett G and Bergmann, Frank T",
  abstract = "Constraint-based modeling is a well established modeling
              methodology used to analyze and study biological networks on both
              a medium and genome scale. Due to their large size and complexity
              such steady-state flux models are, typically, analyzed using
              constraint-based optimization techniques, for example, flux
              balance analysis (FBA). The Flux balance constraints (FBC)
              Package extends SBML Level 3 and provides a standardized format
              for the encoding, exchange and annotation of constraint-based
              models. It includes support for modeling concepts such as
              objective functions, flux bounds and model component annotation
              that facilitates reaction balancing. Version two expands on the
              original release by adding official support for encoding
              gene-protein associations and their associated elements. In
              addition to providing the elements necessary to unambiguously
              encode existing constraint-based models, the FBC Package provides
              an open platform facilitating the continued, cross-community
              development of an interoperable, constraint-based model encoding
              format.",

	abstract = {Glucose is the key metabolic substrate for tissue energy production. In the perinatal period the mother supplies glucose to the fetus and for most of the gestational period the normal lower limit of fetal glucose concentration is around 3 mmol/L. Just after birth, for the first few hours of life in a normal term neonate appropriate for gestational age, blood glucose levels can range between 1.4 mmol/L and 6.2 mmol/L but by about 72 h of age fasting blood glucose levels reach normal infant, child and adult values (3.5{\textendash}5.5 mmol/L). Normal blood glucose levels are maintained within this narrow range by factors which control glucose production and glucose utilisation. The key hormones which regulate glucose homoeostasis include insulin, glucagon, epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol and growth hormone. Pathological states that affect either glucose production or utilisation will lead to hypoglycaemia. Although hypoglycaemia is a common biochemical finding in children (especially in the newborn) it is not possible to define by a single (or a range of) blood glucose value/s. It can be defined as the concentration of glucose in the blood or plasma at which the individual demonstrates a unique response to the abnormal milieu caused by the inadequate delivery of glucose to a target organ (eg, the brain). Hypoglycaemia should therefore be considered as a continuum and the blood glucose level should be interpreted within the clinical scenario and with respect to the counter-regulatory hormonal responses and intermediate metabolites.},
