To what extent was this loss the result of organizational factors at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration? To discuss this question analytically, we need a theory of organizational reliability and agency behavior. Martin Landau's work on redundancy and administrative performance provides a good starting point for such an effort. Expanding on Landau's work, I formulate a more comprehensive theory of organizational reliability that incorporates both type I and type II errors. These principles are then applied in a study of NASA and its administrative behavior before and after the Challenger accident.},

	abstract = {An overview of a comprehensive framework is given for estimating the predictive uncertainty of scientiﬁc computing applications. The framework is comprehensive in the sense that it treats both types of uncertainty (aleatory and epistemic), incorporates uncertainty due to the mathematical form of the model, and it provides a procedure for including estimates of numerical error in the predictive uncertainty. Aleatory (random) uncertainties in model inputs are treated as random variables, while epistemic (lack of knowledge) uncertainties are treated as intervals with no assumed probability distributions. Approaches for propagating both types of uncertainties through the model to the system response quantities of interest are brieﬂy discussed. Numerical approximation errors (due to discretization, iteration, and computer round off) are estimated using veriﬁcation techniques, and the conversion of these errors into epistemic uncertainties is discussed. Model form uncertainty is quantiﬁed using (a) model validation procedures, i.e., statistical comparisons of model predictions to available experimental data, and (b) extrapolation of this uncertainty structure to points in the application domain where experimental data do not exist. Finally, methods for conveying the total predictive uncertainty to decision makers are presented. The different steps in the predictive uncertainty framework are illustrated using a simple example in computational ﬂuid dynamics applied to a hypersonic wind tunnel.},

This is achieved through a two level optimization approach. The first level constructs the CRN through combinations of stoichiometric coefficients of all chemical species and optimized using genetic algorithm. Second level determines the best estimate for the reaction rate constants for each of the reactions using a standard non-linear optimization algorithm. The process is repeated through a number of generations where the genetic algorithm will successively reduce the number of possibilities through elimination of poor CRNs (based on how closely the CRN is able to predict concentration profiles) and retaining and re-optimizing better CRNs. This system’s capability is demonstrated on an experimental data for the reaction between trimethyl orthoacetate and allyl alcohol. The results show that the system is able to develop a CRN that when simulated provides an accurate model (model predictions matching experimental measurements) with little human intervention.},

However, the notion of autocatalytic sets has been defined differently in different modeling contexts, each one having some shortcoming or limitation. Here, we review four such models and definitions, and then formally describe and analyze them in the context of a mathematical framework for studying autocatalytic sets known as RAF theory. The main results are that: (1) RAF theory can capture the various previous definitions of autocatalytic sets and is therefore more complete and general, (2) the formal framework can be used to efficiently detect and analyze autocatalytic sets in all of these different computational models, (3) autocatalytic (RAF) sets are indeed likely to appear and evolve in such models, and (4) this could have important implications for a possible metabolism-first scenario for the origin of life.},

Our solution strategy combines techniques from numerical sensitivity analysis and probabilistic graphical models. By modeling a chemical reaction system as a Markov network (undirected graphical model), we show how systematically probing for sensitivities between molecular species can identify the topology of the network. Given the topology, our approach next uses detailed sensitivity proﬁles to characterize properties of reactions such as reversibility, enzyme-catalysis, and the precise stoichiometries of the reactants and products. We demonstrate applications to reconstructing key biological systems including the yeast cell cycle. In addition to network reconstruction, our algorithm ﬁnds applications in model reduction and model comprehension. We argue that our reconstruction algorithm can serve as an important primitive for data mining in systems biology applications.},

	title = {Identifying frequent patterns in biochemical reaction networks: a workflow},
	volume = {2018},
	abstract = {Computational models in biology encode molecular and cell biological processes. Many of these models can be represented as biochemical reaction networks. Studying such networks, one is mostly interested in systems that share similar reactions and mechanisms. Typical goals of an investigation thus include understanding of model parts, identiﬁcation of reoccurring patterns and recognition of biologically relevant motifs. The large number and size of available models, however, require automated methods to support researchers in achieving their goals. Speciﬁcally for the problem of ﬁnding patterns in large networks only partial solutions exist. We propose a workﬂow that identiﬁes frequent structural patterns in biochemical reaction networks encoded in the Systems Biology Markup Language. The workﬂow utilizes a subgraph mining algorithm to detect the network patterns. Once patterns are identiﬁed, the textual pattern description can automatically be converted into a graphical representation. Furthermore, information about the distribution of patterns among a selected set of models can be retrieved. The workﬂow was validated with 575 models from the curated branch of BioModels. In this paper, we highlight interesting and frequent structural patterns. Furthermore, we provide exemplary patterns that incorporate terms from the Systems Biology Ontology. Our workﬂow can be applied to a custom set of models or to models already existing in our graph database MaSyMoS. The occurrences of frequent patterns may give insight into the encoding of central biological processes, evaluate postulated biological motifs or serve as a similarity measure for models that share common structures.},

The kinetic mechanisms responsible for such oscillations prove to be unexpectedly complicated. It can nevertheless be demonstrated that chemical periodicity is caused by certain kinds of coupling between simultaneous reactions or transport processes. A general survey of the chemistry and phenomenology of the principal chemical oscillations is followed by a discussion of the situations leading to periodic reactions on the basis of the multivariable kinetics of feedback systems. Autocatalysis and autoinhibition play an important role, as also do kinetic instability and spatial propagation.},

Model credibility is the willingness of people to trust a model's predictions and is often difficult to establish for computational biology models. A 3 × 3 matrix has been proposed to allow such models to be categorised with respect to their testability and epistemic foundation in order to guide the selection of an appropriate process of validation to supply evidence to establish credibility. Three approaches to validation are identified that can be deployed depending on whether a model is deemed untestable, testable or lies somewhere in between. In the latter two cases, the validation process involves the quantification of uncertainty which is a key output. The issues arising due to the complexity and inherent variability of biological systems are discussed and the creation of 'digital twins' proposed as a means to alleviate the issues and provide a more robust, transparent and traceable route to model credibility and acceptance.},

Today a toolset of modeling techniques can provide guidance in understanding complexity and in meeting those challenges. Over the last four decades, computational performance increased exponentially. This increase in hardware capacity allowed ever more detailed and computationally intensive models approaching a “one-to-one” representation of the biological reality. Fueled by governmental guidelines like the PAT initiative of the FDA, novel soft sensors and techniques were developed in the past to ensure product quality and provide data in real time. The estimation of current process state and prediction of future process course eventually enabled dynamic process control. In this review, past, present and envisioned future of models in biotechnology are compared and discussed with regard to application in process monitoring, control and optimization. In addition, hardware requirements and availability to fit the needs of increasingly more complex models are summarized. The major techniques and diverse approaches of modeling in industrial biotechnology are compared, and current as well as future trends and perspectives are outlined.},

It is not yet directly applicable to the problems of patients with brain disease. To be used for clinical applications, there must not only be considerable progress in the field but also a concerted effort to use best practices in order to demonstrate model credibility to regulatory bodies, to clinics and hospitals, to doctors, and to patients. In doing this for neuroscience, we can learn lessons from long-standing practices in other areas of simulation (aircraft, computer chips), from software engineering, and from other biomedical disciplines. In this manuscript, we introduce some basic concepts that will be important in the development of credible clinical neuroscience models: reproducibility and replicability; verification and validation; model configuration; and procedures and processes for credible mechanistic multiscale modeling. We also discuss how garnering strong community involvement can promote model credibility. Finally, in addition to direct usage with patients, we note the potential for simulation usage in the area of Simulation-Based Medical Education, an area which to date has been primarily reliant on physical models (mannequins) and scenario-based simulations rather than on numerical simulations.},

Their translation to human results is acknowledged to be poor for decades. Clinical data quality and quantity is also recognized as deficient; gold standard randomized clinical trials are expensive. Few solid conclusions from clinical studies are replicable and many remain unpublished. The translational pathway from fundamental biomedical research through to innovative solutions handed to clinical practitioners is therefore highly inefficient and costly in terms of wasted resources, early claims from fundamental discoveries never witnessed in humans, and few new, improved solutions available clinically for myriad diseases. Improving this biomedical research strategy and resourcing for reliability, translational relevance, reproducibility and clinical impact requires careful analysis and consistent enforcement at both funding and peer review levels.},

	abstract = {The complexities of modern biomedicine are rapidly increasing. Thus, modeling and simulation have become increasingly important as a strategy to understand and predict the trajectory of pathophysiology, disease genesis, and disease spread in support of clinical and policy decisions. In such cases, inappropriate or ill-placed trust in the model and simulation outcomes may result in negative outcomes, and hence illustrate the need to formalize the execution and communication of modeling and simulation practices. Although verification and validation have been generally accepted as significant components of a model’s credibility, they cannot be assumed to equate to a holistic credible practice, which includes activities that can impact comprehension and in-depth examination inherent in the development and reuse of the models. For the past several years, the Committee on Credible Practice of Modeling and Simulation in Healthcare, an interdisciplinary group seeded from a U.S. interagency initiative, has worked to codify best practices. Here, we provide Ten Rules for credible practice of modeling and simulation in healthcare developed from a comparative analysis by the Committee’s multidisciplinary membership, followed by a large stakeholder community survey. These rules establish a unified conceptual framework for modeling and simulation design, implementation, evaluation, dissemination and usage across the modeling and simulation life-cycle. While biomedical science and clinical care domains have somewhat different requirements and expectations for credible practice, our study converged on rules that would be useful across a broad swath of model types. In brief, the rules are: (1) Define context clearly. (2) Use contextually appropriate data. (3) Evaluate within context. (4) List limitations explicitly. (5) Use version control. (6) Document appropriately. (7) Disseminate broadly. (8) Get independent reviews. (9) Test competing implementations. (10) Conform to standards. Although some of these are common sense guidelines, we have found that many are often missed or misconstrued, even by seasoned practitioners. Computational models are already widely used in basic science to generate new biomedical knowledge. As they penetrate clinical care and healthcare policy, contributing to personalized and precision medicine, clinical safety will require established guidelines for the credible practice of modeling and simulation in healthcare.},

	abstract = {The increasing reliance of modern science in computer simulation demands appropriate trust in simulation models for credible results. Because of its foundations in operations research, model credibility is conventionally viewed from the lens of numerical and transformational accuracy. However, the exploratory use of models in scientific discovery, causal explanation, and strategic decision-making render this view incomplete. Recognising the significance of the cognitive interests of model users and the context-sensitive, adaptive nature of building confidence in scientific models, we characterise credibility as trust. Appropriate and justifiable trust is conceptualised as a dynamic, cognitive construct that evolves through interactive, experiential learning. Following the delineation of the dimensions and attributes of trust, conceptual foundations of a dynamic trust model, including alternative measurement strate­ gies, are proposed. Guidelines for trustable models are elaborated to provide a basis for exploiting synergies between the cognitive models of trust and model evaluation.},

	abstract = {In this review, we discuss the science of model validation as it applies to physiological modeling. There is widespread disagreement and ambiguity about what constitutes model validity. In areas in which models affect real-world decision-making, including within the clinic, in regulatory science, or in the design and engineering of novel therapeutics, this question is of critical importance. Without an answer, it impairs the usefulness of models and casts a shadow over model credibility in all domains. To address this question, we examine the use of nonmathematical models in physiological research, in medical practice, and in engineering to see how models in other domains are used and accepted. We reflect on historic physiological models and how they have been presented to the scientific community. Finally, we look at various validation frameworks that have been proposed as potential solutions during the past decade.},

While their benefits are now unanimously recognized, international standards for their evaluation, accepted by all stakeholders involved, are still to be established. In this white paper, we propose a risk-informed evaluation framework for mechanistic model credibility evaluation. To properly frame the proposed verification and validation activities, concepts such as context of use, regulatory impact and risk-based analysis are discussed. To ensure common understanding between all stakeholders, an overview is provided of relevant in silico terminology used throughout this paper. To illustrate the feasibility of the proposed approach, we have applied it to three real case examples in the context of drug development, using a credibility matrix currently being tested as a quick-start tool by regulators. Altogether, this white paper provides a practical approach to model evaluation, applicable in both scientific and regulatory evaluation contexts.},

	abstract = {Different research communities have developed various approaches to assess the credibility of predictive models. Each approach usually works well for a specific type of model, and under some epistemic conditions that are normally satisfied within that specific research domain. Some regulatory agencies recently started to consider evidences of safety and efficacy on new medical products obtained using computer modelling and simulation (which is referred to as In Silico Trials); this has raised the attention in the computational medicine research community on the regulatory science aspects of this emerging discipline. But this poses a foundational problem: in the domain of biomedical research the use of computer modelling is relatively recent, without a widely accepted epistemic framing for model credibility. Also, because of the inherent complexity of living organisms, biomedical modellers tend to use a variety of modelling methods, sometimes mixing them in the solution of a single problem. In such context merely adopting credibility approaches developed within other research communities might not be appropriate. In this paper we propose a theoretical framing for assessing the credibility of a predictive models for In Silico Trials, which accounts for the epistemic specificity of this research field and is general enough to be used for different type of models.},

This endeavor demands close collaboration and communication between modeler and experimenter, which can be facilitated by standards concerning workflows and data formats. We have conducted a survey to find out what the community thinks about the requirements and benefits of standardization efforts; we also evaluated which modeling methods and software tools are being used in the systems biology community. Free availability and flexibility are the top criteria that govern the choice of software tools. SBML is widely recognized as a standard format for systems biology models. Eighty percent of the 125 respondents favor standardization, but there is also consensus that standards should not be enforced at all costs. The most significant demands are standardized formats for experimental data and mathematical models, standardized names for metabolites, reactions and enzymes, and standardized graphical representation of networks.},

	abstract = {Objective: Like all scientific research, computational neuroscience research must be reproducible. Big data science, including simulation research, cannot depend exclusively on journal articles as the method to provide the sharing and transparency required for reproducibility. Methods: Ensuring model reproducibility requires the use of multiple standard software practices and tools, including version control, strong commenting and documentation, and code modularity. Results: Building on these standard practices, model-sharing sites and tools have been developed that fit into several categories: 1) standardized neural simulators; 2) shared computational resources; 3) declarative model descriptors, ontologies, and standardized annotations; and 4) model-sharing repositories and sharing standards. Conclusion: A number of complementary innovations have been proposed to enhance sharing, transparency, and reproducibility. The individual user can be encouraged to make use of version control, commenting, documentation, and modularity in development of models. The community can help by requiring model sharing as a condition of publication and funding. Significance: Model management will become increasingly important as multiscale models become larger, more detailed, and correspondingly more difficult to manage by any single investigator or single laboratory. Additional big data management complexity will come as the models become more useful in interpreting experiments, thus increasing the need to ensure clear alignment between modeling data, both parameters and results, and experiment.},

There are a variety of reasons for this. One of the most likely reasons is that given how busy modern researchers are and the fact that no credit is given to authors for publishing repeatable work, it is inevitable that this will be the case. The situation can only be rectified when government agencies, universities and other research institutions change policies and that journals begin to insist that published work is in fact at least repeatable if not reproducible. In this chapter guidelines are described that can be used by researchers to help make sure their work is repeatable.

We comprehensively list the best practices that biochemical modelers should follow to build reproducible biochemical model artifacts—all data, model descriptions, and custom software used by the model—that can be understood and reused. The best practices provide advice for all steps of a typical biochemical modeling workflow in which a modeler collects data; constructs, trains, simulates, and validates the model; uses the predictions of a model to advance knowledge; and publicly shares the model artifacts. The best practices emphasize the benefits obtained by using standard tools and formats and provides guidance to modelers who do not or cannot use standards in some stages of their modeling workflow. Adoption of these best practices will enhance the ability of researchers to reproduce, understand, and reuse biochemical models.},

Pathway data captures our understanding of biological processes, but its rapid growth necessitates development of databases and computational tools to aid interpretation. However, the current fragmentation of pathway information across many databases with incompatible formats presents barriers to its effective use. BioPAX solves this problem by making pathway data substantially easier to collect, index, interpret and share. BioPAX can represent metabolic and signaling pathways, molecular and genetic interactions and gene regulation networks. BioPAX was created through a community process. Through BioPAX, millions of interactions organized into thousands of pathways across many organisms, from a growing number of sources, are available. Thus, large amounts of pathway data are available in a computable form to support visualization, analysis and biological discovery.},

	abstract = {Background
With the ever increasing use of computational models in the biosciences, the need to share models and reproduce the results of published studies efficiently and easily is becoming more important. To this end, various standards have been proposed that can be used to describe models, simulations, data or other essential information in a consistent fashion. These constitute various separate components required to reproduce a given published scientific result.

Results
We describe the Open Modeling EXchange format (OMEX). Together with the use of other standard formats from the Computational Modeling in Biology Network (COMBINE), OMEX is the basis of the COMBINE Archive, a single file that supports the exchange of all the information necessary for a modeling and simulation experiment in biology. An OMEX file is a ZIP container that includes a manifest file, listing the content of the archive, an optional metadata file adding information about the archive and its content, and the files describing the model. The content of a COMBINE Archive consists of files encoded in COMBINE standards whenever possible, but may include additional files defined by an Internet Media Type. Several tools that support the COMBINE Archive are available, either as independent libraries or embedded in modeling software.

Conclusions
The COMBINE Archive facilitates the reproduction of modeling and simulation experiments in biology by embedding all the relevant information in one file. Having all the information stored and exchanged at once also helps in building activity logs and audit trails. We anticipate that the COMBINE Archive will become a significant help for modellers, as the domain moves to larger, more complex experiments such as multi-scale models of organs, digital organisms, and bioengineering.

Here we review the current best practices when publishing mechanistic models in systems biology. We recommend, where possible, to use software engineering strategies such as testing, veriﬁcation, validation, documentation, versioning, iterative development, and continuous integration. In addition, adhering to the FAIR modeling principles allows other scientists to collaborate and build oﬀ of each other’s work. Existing standards such as SBML, CellML, or SED-ML can greatly improve the likelihood that a published model is reproducible, especially since such models will be deposited in well-established model repositories. Where models are published in executable programming languages, the source code and their data should be published as open-source in public code repositories together with any documentation and testing code. For complex models we recommend container based solutions where any software dependencies and the run-time context can be easily replicated.},

	abstract = {Motivation: The biological pathway exchange language (BioPAX) and the systems biology markup language (SBML) belong to the most popular modeling and data exchange languages in systems biology. The focus of SBML is quantitative modeling and dynamic simulation of models, whereas the BioPAX specification concentrates mainly on visualization and qualitative analysis of pathway maps. BioPAX describes reactions and relations. In contrast, SBML core exclusively describes quantitative processes such as reactions. With the SBML qualitative models extension (qual), it has recently also become possible to describe relations in SBML. Before the development of SBML qual, relations could not be properly translated into SBML. Until now, there exists no BioPAX to SBML converter that is fully capable of translating both reactions and relations., Results: The entire nature pathway interaction database has been converted from BioPAX (Level 2 and Level 3) into SBML (Level 3 Version 1) including both reactions and relations by using the new qual extension package. Additionally, we present the new webtool BioPAX2SBML for further BioPAX to SBML conversions. Compared with previous conversion tools, BioPAX2SBML is more comprehensive, more robust and more exact., Availability: BioPAX2SBML is freely available at http://webservices.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/ and the complete collection of the PID models is available at http://www.cogsys.cs.uni-tuebingen.de/downloads/Qualitative-Models/., Contact:

To provide a platform to support universal sharing, easy accessibility and model reproducibility, BioModels (https://www.ebi.ac.uk/biomodels/), a repository for mathematical models, was established in 2005. The current BioModels platform allows submission of models encoded in diverse modelling formats, including SBML, CellML, PharmML, COMBINE archive, MATLAB, Mathematica, R, Python or C++. The models submitted to BioModels are curated to verify the computational representation of the biological process and the reproducibility of the simulation results in the reference publication. The curation also involves encoding models in standard formats and annotation with controlled vocabularies following MIRIAM (minimal information required in the annotation of biochemical models) guidelines. BioModels now accepts large-scale submission of auto-generated computational models. With gradual growth in content over 15 years, BioModels currently hosts about 2000 models from the published literature. With about 800 curated models, BioModels has become the world’s largest repository of curated models and emerged as the third most used data resource after PubMed and Google Scholar among the scientists who use modelling in their research. Thus, BioModels benefits modellers by providing access to reliable and semantically enriched curated models in standard formats that are easy to share, reproduce and reuse.}",

  abstract = "Constraint-based modeling is a well established modeling
              methodology used to analyze and study biological networks on both
              a medium and genome scale. Due to their large size and complexity
              such steady-state flux models are, typically, analyzed using
              constraint-based optimization techniques, for example, flux
              balance analysis (FBA). The Flux balance constraints (FBC)
              Package extends SBML Level 3 and provides a standardized format
              for the encoding, exchange and annotation of constraint-based
              models. It includes support for modeling concepts such as
              objective functions, flux bounds and model component annotation
              that facilitates reaction balancing. Version two expands on the
              original release by adding official support for encoding
              gene-protein associations and their associated elements. In
              addition to providing the elements necessary to unambiguously
              encode existing constraint-based models, the FBC Package provides
              an open platform facilitating the continued, cross-community
              development of an interoperable, constraint-based model encoding

	abstract = {Glucose is the key metabolic substrate for tissue energy production. In the perinatal period the mother supplies glucose to the fetus and for most of the gestational period the normal lower limit of fetal glucose concentration is around 3 mmol/L. Just after birth, for the first few hours of life in a normal term neonate appropriate for gestational age, blood glucose levels can range between 1.4 mmol/L and 6.2 mmol/L but by about 72 h of age fasting blood glucose levels reach normal infant, child and adult values (3.5{\textendash}5.5 mmol/L). Normal blood glucose levels are maintained within this narrow range by factors which control glucose production and glucose utilisation. The key hormones which regulate glucose homoeostasis include insulin, glucagon, epinephrine, norepinephrine, cortisol and growth hormone. Pathological states that affect either glucose production or utilisation will lead to hypoglycaemia. Although hypoglycaemia is a common biochemical finding in children (especially in the newborn) it is not possible to define by a single (or a range of) blood glucose value/s. It can be defined as the concentration of glucose in the blood or plasma at which the individual demonstrates a unique response to the abnormal milieu caused by the inadequate delivery of glucose to a target organ (eg, the brain). Hypoglycaemia should therefore be considered as a continuum and the blood glucose level should be interpreted within the clinical scenario and with respect to the counter-regulatory hormonal responses and intermediate metabolites.},

To what extent was this loss the result of organizational factors at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration? To discuss this question analytically, we need a theory of organizational reliability and agency behavior. Martin Landau's work on redundancy and administrative performance provides a good starting point for such an effort. Expanding on Landau's work, I formulate a more comprehensive theory of organizational reliability that incorporates both type I and type II errors. These principles are then applied in a study of NASA and its administrative behavior before and after the Challenger accident.},

	abstract = {An overview of a comprehensive framework is given for estimating the predictive uncertainty of scientiﬁc computing applications. The framework is comprehensive in the sense that it treats both types of uncertainty (aleatory and epistemic), incorporates uncertainty due to the mathematical form of the model, and it provides a procedure for including estimates of numerical error in the predictive uncertainty. Aleatory (random) uncertainties in model inputs are treated as random variables, while epistemic (lack of knowledge) uncertainties are treated as intervals with no assumed probability distributions. Approaches for propagating both types of uncertainties through the model to the system response quantities of interest are brieﬂy discussed. Numerical approximation errors (due to discretization, iteration, and computer round off) are estimated using veriﬁcation techniques, and the conversion of these errors into epistemic uncertainties is discussed. Model form uncertainty is quantiﬁed using (a) model validation procedures, i.e., statistical comparisons of model predictions to available experimental data, and (b) extrapolation of this uncertainty structure to points in the application domain where experimental data do not exist. Finally, methods for conveying the total predictive uncertainty to decision makers are presented. The different steps in the predictive uncertainty framework are illustrated using a simple example in computational ﬂuid dynamics applied to a hypersonic wind tunnel.},

Text-based model definition languages allow researchers to create models simply, and then export them to a common exchange format. Modular languages allow researchers to create and combine complex models more easily. We saw a use for a modular text-based language, together with a translation library to allow other programs to read the models as well., Summary: The Antimony language provides a way for a researcher to use simple text statements to create, import, and combine biological models, allowing complex models to be built from simpler models, and provides a special syntax for the creation of modular genetic networks. The libAntimony library allows other software packages to import these models and convert them either to SBML or their own internal format., Availability: The Antimony language specification and the libAntimony library are available under a BSD license from http://antimony.sourceforge.net/, Contact: lpsmith@u.washington.edu},

This is achieved through a two level optimization approach. The first level constructs the CRN through combinations of stoichiometric coefficients of all chemical species and optimized using genetic algorithm. Second level determines the best estimate for the reaction rate constants for each of the reactions using a standard non-linear optimization algorithm. The process is repeated through a number of generations where the genetic algorithm will successively reduce the number of possibilities through elimination of poor CRNs (based on how closely the CRN is able to predict concentration profiles) and retaining and re-optimizing better CRNs. This system’s capability is demonstrated on an experimental data for the reaction between trimethyl orthoacetate and allyl alcohol. The results show that the system is able to develop a CRN that when simulated provides an accurate model (model predictions matching experimental measurements) with little human intervention.},

However, the notion of autocatalytic sets has been defined differently in different modeling contexts, each one having some shortcoming or limitation. Here, we review four such models and definitions, and then formally describe and analyze them in the context of a mathematical framework for studying autocatalytic sets known as RAF theory. The main results are that: (1) RAF theory can capture the various previous definitions of autocatalytic sets and is therefore more complete and general, (2) the formal framework can be used to efficiently detect and analyze autocatalytic sets in all of these different computational models, (3) autocatalytic (RAF) sets are indeed likely to appear and evolve in such models, and (4) this could have important implications for a possible metabolism-first scenario for the origin of life.},

Our solution strategy combines techniques from numerical sensitivity analysis and probabilistic graphical models. By modeling a chemical reaction system as a Markov network (undirected graphical model), we show how systematically probing for sensitivities between molecular species can identify the topology of the network. Given the topology, our approach next uses detailed sensitivity proﬁles to characterize properties of reactions such as reversibility, enzyme-catalysis, and the precise stoichiometries of the reactants and products. We demonstrate applications to reconstructing key biological systems including the yeast cell cycle. In addition to network reconstruction, our algorithm ﬁnds applications in model reduction and model comprehension. We argue that our reconstruction algorithm can serve as an important primitive for data mining in systems biology applications.},

	title = {Identifying frequent patterns in biochemical reaction networks: a workflow},
	volume = {2018},
	abstract = {Computational models in biology encode molecular and cell biological processes. Many of these models can be represented as biochemical reaction networks. Studying such networks, one is mostly interested in systems that share similar reactions and mechanisms. Typical goals of an investigation thus include understanding of model parts, identiﬁcation of reoccurring patterns and recognition of biologically relevant motifs. The large number and size of available models, however, require automated methods to support researchers in achieving their goals. Speciﬁcally for the problem of ﬁnding patterns in large networks only partial solutions exist. We propose a workﬂow that identiﬁes frequent structural patterns in biochemical reaction networks encoded in the Systems Biology Markup Language. The workﬂow utilizes a subgraph mining algorithm to detect the network patterns. Once patterns are identiﬁed, the textual pattern description can automatically be converted into a graphical representation. Furthermore, information about the distribution of patterns among a selected set of models can be retrieved. The workﬂow was validated with 575 models from the curated branch of BioModels. In this paper, we highlight interesting and frequent structural patterns. Furthermore, we provide exemplary patterns that incorporate terms from the Systems Biology Ontology. Our workﬂow can be applied to a custom set of models or to models already existing in our graph database MaSyMoS. The occurrences of frequent patterns may give insight into the encoding of central biological processes, evaluate postulated biological motifs or serve as a similarity measure for models that share common structures.},

We consider specific examples of oscillatory processes and discuss four general requirements for biochemical oscillations: negative feedback, time delay, sufficient ‘nonlinearity’ of the reaction kinetics and proper balancing of the timescales of opposing chemical reactions. Positive feedback is one mechanism to delay the negative-feedback signal. Biological oscillators can be classified according to the topology of the positive- and negative-feedback loops in the underlying regulatory mechanism.},

This document summarizes these discussions, presents difficulties, and mentions existing efforts towards future solutions that will allow future model utility and integration.

Model credibility is the willingness of people to trust a model's predictions and is often difficult to establish for computational biology models. A 3 × 3 matrix has been proposed to allow such models to be categorised with respect to their testability and epistemic foundation in order to guide the selection of an appropriate process of validation to supply evidence to establish credibility. Three approaches to validation are identified that can be deployed depending on whether a model is deemed untestable, testable or lies somewhere in between. In the latter two cases, the validation process involves the quantification of uncertainty which is a key output. The issues arising due to the complexity and inherent variability of biological systems are discussed and the creation of 'digital twins' proposed as a means to alleviate the issues and provide a more robust, transparent and traceable route to model credibility and acceptance.},

Today a toolset of modeling techniques can provide guidance in understanding complexity and in meeting those challenges. Over the last four decades, computational performance increased exponentially. This increase in hardware capacity allowed ever more detailed and computationally intensive models approaching a “one-to-one” representation of the biological reality. Fueled by governmental guidelines like the PAT initiative of the FDA, novel soft sensors and techniques were developed in the past to ensure product quality and provide data in real time. The estimation of current process state and prediction of future process course eventually enabled dynamic process control. In this review, past, present and envisioned future of models in biotechnology are compared and discussed with regard to application in process monitoring, control and optimization. In addition, hardware requirements and availability to fit the needs of increasingly more complex models are summarized. The major techniques and diverse approaches of modeling in industrial biotechnology are compared, and current as well as future trends and perspectives are outlined.},

It is not yet directly applicable to the problems of patients with brain disease. To be used for clinical applications, there must not only be considerable progress in the field but also a concerted effort to use best practices in order to demonstrate model credibility to regulatory bodies, to clinics and hospitals, to doctors, and to patients. In doing this for neuroscience, we can learn lessons from long-standing practices in other areas of simulation (aircraft, computer chips), from software engineering, and from other biomedical disciplines. In this manuscript, we introduce some basic concepts that will be important in the development of credible clinical neuroscience models: reproducibility and replicability; verification and validation; model configuration; and procedures and processes for credible mechanistic multiscale modeling. We also discuss how garnering strong community involvement can promote model credibility. Finally, in addition to direct usage with patients, we note the potential for simulation usage in the area of Simulation-Based Medical Education, an area which to date has been primarily reliant on physical models (mannequins) and scenario-based simulations rather than on numerical simulations.},

Preclinical models of disease and therapy, largely conducted in rodents, have known deficiencies in replicating most human conditions. Their translation to human results is acknowledged to be poor for decades. Clinical data quality and quantity is also recognized as deficient; gold standard randomized clinical trials are expensive. Few solid conclusions from clinical studies are replicable and many remain unpublished. The translational pathway from fundamental biomedical research through to innovative solutions handed to clinical practitioners is therefore highly inefficient and costly in terms of wasted resources, early claims from fundamental discoveries never witnessed in humans, and few new, improved solutions available clinically for myriad diseases. Improving this biomedical research strategy and resourcing for reliability, translational relevance, reproducibility and clinical impact requires careful analysis and consistent enforcement at both funding and peer review levels.},

	abstract = {The complexities of modern biomedicine are rapidly increasing. Thus, modeling and simulation have become increasingly important as a strategy to understand and predict the trajectory of pathophysiology, disease genesis, and disease spread in support of clinical and policy decisions. In such cases, inappropriate or ill-placed trust in the model and simulation outcomes may result in negative outcomes, and hence illustrate the need to formalize the execution and communication of modeling and simulation practices. Although verification and validation have been generally accepted as significant components of a model’s credibility, they cannot be assumed to equate to a holistic credible practice, which includes activities that can impact comprehension and in-depth examination inherent in the development and reuse of the models. For the past several years, the Committee on Credible Practice of Modeling and Simulation in Healthcare, an interdisciplinary group seeded from a U.S. interagency initiative, has worked to codify best practices. Here, we provide Ten Rules for credible practice of modeling and simulation in healthcare developed from a comparative analysis by the Committee’s multidisciplinary membership, followed by a large stakeholder community survey. These rules establish a unified conceptual framework for modeling and simulation design, implementation, evaluation, dissemination and usage across the modeling and simulation life-cycle. While biomedical science and clinical care domains have somewhat different requirements and expectations for credible practice, our study converged on rules that would be useful across a broad swath of model types. In brief, the rules are: (1) Define context clearly. (2) Use contextually appropriate data. (3) Evaluate within context. (4) List limitations explicitly. (5) Use version control. (6) Document appropriately. (7) Disseminate broadly. (8) Get independent reviews. (9) Test competing implementations. (10) Conform to standards. Although some of these are common sense guidelines, we have found that many are often missed or misconstrued, even by seasoned practitioners. Computational models are already widely used in basic science to generate new biomedical knowledge. As they penetrate clinical care and healthcare policy, contributing to personalized and precision medicine, clinical safety will require established guidelines for the credible practice of modeling and simulation in healthcare.},

	abstract = {The increasing reliance of modern science in computer simulation demands appropriate trust in simulation models for credible results. Because of its foundations in operations research, model credibility is conventionally viewed from the lens of numerical and transformational accuracy. However, the exploratory use of models in scientific discovery, causal explanation, and strategic decision-making render this view incomplete. Recognising the significance of the cognitive interests of model users and the context-sensitive, adaptive nature of building confidence in scientific models, we characterise credibility as trust. Appropriate and justifiable trust is conceptualised as a dynamic, cognitive construct that evolves through interactive, experiential learning. Following the delineation of the dimensions and attributes of trust, conceptual foundations of a dynamic trust model, including alternative measurement strate­ gies, are proposed. Guidelines for trustable models are elaborated to provide a basis for exploiting synergies between the cognitive models of trust and model evaluation.},

In areas in which models affect real-world decision-making, including within the clinic, in regulatory science, or in the design and engineering of novel therapeutics, this question is of critical importance. Without an answer, it impairs the usefulness of models and casts a shadow over model credibility in all domains. To address this question, we examine the use of nonmathematical models in physiological research, in medical practice, and in engineering to see how models in other domains are used and accepted. We reflect on historic physiological models and how they have been presented to the scientific community. Finally, we look at various validation frameworks that have been proposed as potential solutions during the past decade.},

To properly frame the proposed verification and validation activities, concepts such as context of use, regulatory impact and risk-based analysis are discussed. To ensure common understanding between all stakeholders, an overview is provided of relevant in silico terminology used throughout this paper. To illustrate the feasibility of the proposed approach, we have applied it to three real case examples in the context of drug development, using a credibility matrix currently being tested as a quick-start tool by regulators.

Each approach usually works well for a specific type of model, and under some epistemic conditions that are normally satisfied within that specific research domain. Some regulatory agencies recently started to consider evidences of safety and efficacy on new medical products obtained using computer modelling and simulation (which is referred to as In Silico Trials); this has raised the attention in the computational medicine research community on the regulatory science aspects of this emerging discipline. But this poses a foundational problem: in the domain of biomedical research the use of computer modelling is relatively recent, without a widely accepted epistemic framing for model credibility. Also, because of the inherent complexity of living organisms, biomedical modellers tend to use a variety of modelling methods, sometimes mixing them in the solution of a single problem. In such context merely adopting credibility approaches developed within other research communities might not be appropriate. In this paper we propose a theoretical framing for assessing the credibility of a predictive models for In Silico Trials, which accounts for the epistemic specificity of this research field and is general enough to be used for different type of models.},

	abstract = {Objective: Like all scientific research, computational neuroscience research must be reproducible. Big data science, including simulation research, cannot depend exclusively on journal articles as the method to provide the sharing and transparency required for reproducibility. Methods: Ensuring model reproducibility requires the use of multiple standard software practices and tools, including version control, strong commenting and documentation, and code modularity. Results: Building on these standard practices, model-sharing sites and tools have been developed that fit into several categories: 1) standardized neural simulators; 2) shared computational resources; 3) declarative model descriptors, ontologies, and standardized annotations; and 4) model-sharing repositories and sharing standards. Conclusion: A number of complementary innovations have been proposed to enhance sharing, transparency, and reproducibility. The individual user can be encouraged to make use of version control, commenting, documentation, and modularity in development of models. The community can help by requiring model sharing as a condition of publication and funding. Significance: Model management will become increasingly important as multiscale models become larger, more detailed, and correspondingly more difficult to manage by any single investigator or single laboratory. Additional big data management complexity will come as the models become more useful in interpreting experiments, thus increasing the need to ensure clear alignment between modeling data, both parameters and results, and experiment.},

There are a variety of reasons for this. One of the most likely reasons is that given how busy modern researchers are and the fact that no credit is given to authors for publishing repeatable work, it is inevitable that this will be the case. The situation can only be rectified when government agencies, universities and other research institutions change policies and that journals begin to insist that published work is in fact at least repeatable if not reproducible. In this chapter guidelines are described that can be used by researchers to help make sure their work is repeatable. A scoring system is suggested that authors can use to determine how well they are doing.},

BioPAX can represent metabolic and signaling pathways, molecular and genetic interactions and gene regulation networks. BioPAX was created through a community process. Through BioPAX, millions of interactions organized into thousands of pathways across many organisms, from a growing number of sources, are available.

	abstract = {Background
With the ever increasing use of computational models in the biosciences, the need to share models and reproduce the results of published studies efficiently and easily is becoming more important. To this end, various standards have been proposed that can be used to describe models, simulations, data or other essential information in a consistent fashion. These constitute various separate components required to reproduce a given published scientific result.

Results
We describe the Open Modeling EXchange format (OMEX). Together with the use of other standard formats from the Computational Modeling in Biology Network (COMBINE), OMEX is the basis of the COMBINE Archive, a single file that supports the exchange of all the information necessary for a modeling and simulation experiment in biology. An OMEX file is a ZIP container that includes a manifest file, listing the content of the archive, an optional metadata file adding information about the archive and its content, and the files describing the model. The content of a COMBINE Archive consists of files encoded in COMBINE standards whenever possible, but may include additional files defined by an Internet Media Type. Several tools that support the COMBINE Archive are available, either as independent libraries or embedded in modeling software.

Conclusions
The COMBINE Archive facilitates the reproduction of modeling and simulation experiments in biology by embedding all the relevant information in one file. Having all the information stored and exchanged at once also helps in building activity logs and audit trails. We anticipate that the COMBINE Archive will become a significant help for modellers, as the domain moves to larger, more complex experiments such as multi-scale models of organs, digital organisms, and bioengineering.

Here we review the current best practices when publishing mechanistic models in systems biology. We recommend, where possible, to use software engineering strategies such as testing, veriﬁcation, validation, documentation, versioning, iterative development, and continuous integration. In addition, adhering to the FAIR modeling principles allows other scientists to collaborate and build oﬀ of each other’s work. Existing standards such as SBML, CellML, or SED-ML can greatly improve the likelihood that a published model is reproducible, especially since such models will be deposited in well-established model repositories. Where models are published in executable programming languages, the source code and their data should be published as open-source in public code repositories together with any documentation and testing code. For complex models we recommend container based solutions where any software dependencies and the run-time context can be easily replicated.},

	abstract = {Motivation: The biological pathway exchange language (BioPAX) and the systems biology markup language (SBML) belong to the most popular modeling and data exchange languages in systems biology. The focus of SBML is quantitative modeling and dynamic simulation of models, whereas the BioPAX specification concentrates mainly on visualization and qualitative analysis of pathway maps. BioPAX describes reactions and relations. In contrast, SBML core exclusively describes quantitative processes such as reactions. With the SBML qualitative models extension (qual), it has recently also become possible to describe relations in SBML. Before the development of SBML qual, relations could not be properly translated into SBML. Until now, there exists no BioPAX to SBML converter that is fully capable of translating both reactions and relations., Results: The entire nature pathway interaction database has been converted from BioPAX (Level 2 and Level 3) into SBML (Level 3 Version 1) including both reactions and relations by using the new qual extension package. Additionally, we present the new webtool BioPAX2SBML for further BioPAX to SBML conversions.

This is an indirect result from the Space Shuttle Columbia Accident Investigation Board (CAIB), which eventually resulted in an action, among others, to improve the rigor in NASA's M\&S practices. The focus of this action came to mean a standardized method for assessing and reporting results from any type of M\&S. As is typical in the standards development process, this necessarily developed into defming a common terminology base, common documentation requirements (especially for M\&S used in critical decision making), and a method for assessing the credibility of M\&S results. What surfaced in the development of the NASA Standard was the various dimensions credibility to consider when accepting the results from any model or simulation analysis. The eight generally relevant factors of credibility chosen in the NASA Standard proved only one aspect in the dimensionality of M\&S credibility. At the next level of detail, the full comprehension of some of the factors requires an understanding along a couple of dimensions as well. Included in this discussion are the prerequisites for the appropriate use of a given M\&S, the choice of factors in credibility assessment with their inherent dimensionality, and minimum requirements for fully reporting M\&S results.},

This article extends model error checking to include: (i) certain structural errors in reaction networks and (ii) error isolation. First, we consider the balance of chemical structures (moieties) between reactants and products. This balance is expected in many biochemical reactions, but the imbalance of chemical structures cannot be detected if the analysis is done in units of atomic masses. Second, we improve on error isolation for stoichiometric inconsistencies by identifying a small number of reactions and/or species that cause the error. Doing so simpliﬁes error remediation.},

Reproducibility is the cornerstone of the scientific method. However,
currently, many systems biology models cannot easily be reproduced. This
paper presents methods that address this problem.

Methods
We analyzed the recent Mycoplasma genitalium
whole-cell (WC) model to determine the requirements for reproducible
modeling.

Results
We determined that reproducible modeling requires both repeatable
model building and repeatable simulation.

Conclusion
New standards and simulation software tools are needed to enhance and
verify the reproducibility of modeling. New standards are needed to
explicitly document every data source and assumption, and new deterministic
parallel simulation tools are needed to quickly simulate large, complex
models.

Significance
We anticipate that these new standards and software will enable
researchers to reproducibly build and simulate more complex models,
including WC models.},

	abstract = {Motivation: The growing complexity of reaction-based models necessitates early detection and resolution of model errors. This paper addresses mass balance errors, discrepancies between the mass of reactants and products in reaction speciﬁcations. One approach to detection is atomic mass analysis, which uses meta-data to expose atomic formulas of chemical species. Atomic mass analysis isolates errors to individual reactions. However, this approach burdens modelers with expressing model meta-data and writing excessively detailed reactions that include implicit chemical species (e.g., water). Moreover, atomic mass analysis has the shortcoming of not being applicable to large molecules because of the limitations of current annotation techniques. The second approach, Linear Programming (LP) analysis, avoids using model meta-data by checking for a weaker condition, stoichiometric inconsistency. But this approach suffers from false negatives and has large isolation sets (the set of reactions implicated in the stoichiometric inconsistency). Results: We propose alternatives to both approaches. Our alternative to atomic mass analysis is moiety analysis. Moiety analysis uses model meta-data in the form of moieties present in chemical species. Moiety analysis avoids excessively detailed reaction speciﬁcations, and can be used with large molecules. Our alternative to LP analysis is Graphical Analysis of Mass Equivalence Sets (GAMES). GAMES has a slightly higher false negative rate than LP analysis, but it provides much better error isolation. In our studies of the BioModels Repository, the average size of isolation sets for LP analysis is 55.5; for GAMES, it is 5.4. We have created open source codes for moiety analysis and GAMES.

It includes support for modeling concepts such as objective functions, flux bounds and model component annotation that facilitates reaction balancing. Version two expands on the original release by adding official support for encoding gene-protein associations and their associated elements.

	abstract = {Protecting and promoting public health is the mission of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA). FDA’s Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), which regulates medical devices marketed in the U.S., envisions itself as the world’s leader in medical device innovation and regulatory science–the development of new methods, standards, and approaches to assess the safety, efﬁcacy, quality, and performance of medical devices. Traditionally, bench testing, animal studies, and clinical trials have been the main sources of evidence for getting medical devices on the market in the U.S. In recent years, however, computational modeling has become an increasingly powerful tool for evaluating medical devices, complementing bench, animal and clinical methods. Moreover, computational modeling methods are increasingly being used within software platforms, serving as clinical decision support tools, and are being embedded in medical devices. Because of its reach and huge potential, computational modeling has been identiﬁed as a priority by CDRH, and indeed by FDA’s leadership. Therefore, the Ofﬁce of Science and Engineering Laboratories (OSEL)—the research arm of CDRH—has committed signiﬁcant resources to transforming computational modeling from a valuable scientiﬁc tool to a valuable regulatory tool, and developing mechanisms to rely more on digital evidence in place of other evidence. This article introduces the role of computational modeling for medical devices, describes OSEL’s ongoing research, and overviews how evidence from computational modeling (i.e., digital evidence) has been used in regulatory submissions by industry to CDRH in recent years. It concludes by discussing the potential future role for computational modeling and digital evidence in medical devices.},

The Research Object has recently emerged as a comprehensive and systematic method for aggregation and identification of diverse elements of computational experiments. While a necessary method, mere aggregation is not sufficient for the sharing of computational experiments. Other users must be able to easily recompute on these shared research objects. In this paper, we present the sciunit, a reusable research object in which aggregated content is recomputable. We describe a Git-like client that efficiently creates, stores, and repeats sciunits. We show through analysis that sciunits repeat computational experiments with minimal storage and processing overhead.

	abstract = {Objective
Like all scientific research, computational neuroscience research
must be reproducible. Big data science, including simulation research,
cannot depend exclusively on journal articles as the method to provide the
sharing and transparency required for reproducibility.

Methods
Ensuring model reproducibility requires the use of multiple standard
software practices and tools, including version control, strong commenting
and documentation, and code modularity.

Results
Building on these standard practices, model sharing sites and tools
have been developed that fit into several categories: 1. standardized neural
simulators, 2. shared computational resources, 3. declarative model
descriptors, ontologies and standardized annotations; 4. model sharing
repositories and sharing standards.

Conclusion
A number of complementary innovations have been proposed to enhance
sharing, transparency and reproducibility. The individual user can be
encouraged to make use of version control, commenting, documentation and
modularity in development of models. The community can help by requiring
model sharing as a condition of publication and funding.

Significance
Model management will become increasingly important as multiscale
models become larger, more detailed and correspondingly more difficult to
manage by any single investigator or single laboratory. Additional
big data management complexity will come as the models
become more useful in interpreting experiments, thus increasing the need to
ensure clear alignment between modeling data, both parameters and results,
and experiment.},

Ideally, the bio-modeling community shall be able assess systems biology models based on objective and quantitative metrics. This is because metric-based model design not only can accelerate the validation process, but also can improve the efficacy of model design. In addition, the metric will enable researchers to select models with any desired quality standards to study biological pathway. In this case study, we compare popular systems biology modeling approaches such as Michaelis-Menten kinetics and generalized mass action and flux balance analysis to examine the difficulties in developing quantitative metrics for bio-model assessment. We created a set of guidelines in evaluating the efficacy of various bio-modeling approaches and system analysis in several ";bio-systems of interest";. We found that quantitative scoring metrics are essential aids for (i) model adopters and users to determine fundamental distinctions among bio-models, and (ii) model developers to improve key areas in bio-modeling. Eventually, we want to extend this evaluation practice to broad systems biology modeling.},

Constraints based models of this form can include thousands of reactions and metabolites, with many crucial pathways that only become activated in speciﬁc simulation settings. However, despite their widespread use, power and the availability of tools to aid with the construction and analysis of large scale models, little methodology is suggested for their continued management. For example, when genome annotations are updated or new understanding regarding behaviour is discovered, models often need to be altered to reﬂect this. This is quickly becoming an issue for industrial systems and synthetic biotechnology applications, which require good quality reusable models integral to the design, build, test and learn cycle.},

	abstract = {Collaborative genome-scale reconstruction endeavors of metabolic networks would not be possible without a common, standardized formal representation of these systems. The ability to precisely define biological building blocks together with their dynamic behavior has even been considered a prerequisite for upcoming synthetic biology approaches. Driven by the requirements of such ambitious research goals, standardization itself has become an active field of research on nearly all levels of granularity in biology. In addition to the originally envisaged exchange of computational models and tool interoperability, new standards have been suggested for an unambiguous graphical display of biological phenomena, to annotate, archive, as well as to rank models, and to describe execution and the outcomes of simulation experiments. The spectrum now even covers the interaction of entire neurons in the brain, three-dimensional motions, and the description of pharmacometric studies. Thereby, the mathematical description of systems and approaches for their (repeated) simulation are clearly separated from each other and also from their graphical representation. Minimum information definitions constitute guidelines and common operation protocols in order to ensure reproducibility of findings and a unified knowledge representation. Central database infrastructures have been established that provide the scientific community with persistent links from model annotations to online resources. A rich variety of open-source software tools thrives for all data formats, often supporting a multitude of programing languages. Regular meetings and workshops of developers and users lead to continuous improvement and ongoing development of these standardization efforts. This article gives a brief overview about the current state of the growing number of operation protocols, mark-up languages, graphical descriptions, and fundamental software support with relevance to systems biology.},

Semantic annotation is a critical component for enhancing the interoperability and reusability of such models as well as for the integration of the data needed for model parameterization and validation. Encoded as machine-readable links to knowledge resource terms, semantic annotations describe the computational or biological meaning of what models and data represent. These annotations help researchers find and repurpose models, accelerate model composition and enable knowledge integration across model repositories and experimental data stores. However, realizing the potential benefits of semantic annotation requires the development of model annotation standards that adhere to a community-based annotation protocol. Without such standards, tool developers must account for a variety of annotation formats and approaches, a situation that can become prohibitively cumbersome and which can defeat the purpose of linking model elements to controlled knowledge resource terms. Currently, no consensus protocol for semantic annotation exists among the larger biological modeling community. Here, we report on the landscape of current annotation practices among the COmputational Modeling in BIology NEtwork community and provide a set of recommendations for building a consensus approach to semantic annotation.},

SemanticSBML is a tool that helps users to check and edit MIRIAM annotations and SBO terms in SBML models. Using a large collection of biochemical names and database identiﬁers, it supports modellers in ﬁnding the right annotations and in merging existing models. Initially, an element matching is derived from the MIRIAM annotations and conﬂicting element attributes are categorized and highlighted. Conﬂicts can then be resolved automatically or manually, allowing the user to control the merging process in detail.},

Distributing modeling projects within an OMEX archive is a best practice established by COMBINE, and the OMEX metadata specification presented here provides a harmonized, community-driven approach for annotating a variety of standardized model representations.

	abstract = {The complexities of modern biomedicine are rapidly increasing. Thus, modeling and simulation have become increasingly important as a strategy to understand and predict the trajectory of pathophysiology, disease genesis, and disease spread in support of clinical and policy decisions. In such cases, inappropriate or ill-placed trust in the model and simulation outcomes may result in negative outcomes, and hence illustrate the need to formalize the execution and communication of modeling and simulation practices. Although verification and validation have been generally accepted as significant components of a model’s credibility, they cannot be assumed to equate to a holistic credible practice, which includes activities that can impact comprehension and in-depth examination inherent in the development and reuse of the models. For the past several years, the Committee on Credible Practice of Modeling and Simulation in Healthcare, an interdisciplinary group seeded from a U.S. interagency initiative, has worked to codify best practices. Here, we provide Ten Rules for credible practice of modeling and simulation in healthcare developed from a comparative analysis by the Committee’s multidisciplinary membership, followed by a large stakeholder community survey. These rules establish a unified conceptual framework for modeling and simulation design, implementation, evaluation, dissemination and usage across the modeling and simulation life-cycle. While biomedical science and clinical care domains have somewhat different requirements and expectations for credible practice, our study converged on rules that would be useful across a broad swath of model types. In brief, the rules are: (1) Define context clearly. (2) Use contextually appropriate data. (3) Evaluate within context. (4) List limitations explicitly. (5) Use version control. (6) Document appropriately. (7) Disseminate broadly. (8) Get independent reviews. (9) Test competing implementations. (10) Conform to standards. Although some of these are common sense guidelines, we have found that many are often missed or misconstrued, even by seasoned practitioners. Computational models are already widely used in basic science to generate new biomedical knowledge. As they penetrate clinical care and healthcare policy, contributing to personalized and precision medicine, clinical safety will require established guidelines for the credible practice of modeling and simulation in healthcare.},

            With the rise of Systems Biology as a new paradigm for understanding biological processes, the development of quantitative models is no longer restricted to a small circle of theoreticians. The dramatic increase in the number of these models precipitates the need to exchange and reuse both existing and newly created models. The Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) is a free, open, XML-based format for representing quantitative models of biological interest that advocates the consistent specification of such models and thus facilitates both software development and model exchange.Principally oriented towards describing systems of biochemical reactions, such as cell signalling pathways, metabolic networks and gene regulation etc., SBML can also be used to encode any kinetic model. SBML offers mechanisms to describe biological components by means of compartments and reacting species, as well as their dynamic behaviour, using reactions, events and arbitrary mathematical rules. SBML also offers all the housekeeping structures needed to ensure an unambiguous understanding of quantitative descriptions.This is Release 1 of the specification for SBML Level 2 Version 4, describing the structures of the language and the rules used to build a valid model. SBML XML Schema and other related documents and software are also available from the SBML project web site, "http://sbml.org/":http://sbml.org/.},

FDA's Center for Devices and Radiological Health (CDRH), which regulates medical devices marketed in the U.S., envisions itself as the world's leader in medical device innovation and regulatory science–the development of new methods, standards, and approaches to assess the safety, efficacy, quality, and performance of medical devices. Traditionally, bench testing, animal studies, and clinical trials have been the main sources of evidence for getting medical devices on the market in the U.S. In recent years, however, computational modeling has become an increasingly powerful tool for evaluating medical devices, complementing bench, animal and clinical methods. Moreover, computational modeling methods are increasingly being used within software platforms, serving as clinical decision support tools, and are being embedded in medical devices. Because of its reach and huge potential, computational modeling has been identified as a priority by CDRH, and indeed by FDA's leadership. Therefore, the Office of Science and Engineering Laboratories (OSEL)—the research arm of CDRH—has committed significant resources to transforming computational modeling from a valuable scientific tool to a valuable regulatory tool, and developing mechanisms to rely more on digital evidence in place of other evidence. This article introduces the role of computational modeling for medical devices, describes OSEL's ongoing research, and overviews how evidence from computational modeling (i.e., digital evidence) has been used in regulatory submissions by industry to CDRH in recent years. It concludes by discussing the potential future role for computational modeling and digital evidence in medical devices.},

Computational-modelling approaches play a key role in the analysis of the underlying molecular processes and pathways that characterize human biology, but they also lead to a more profound understanding of the mechanisms and factors that drive diseases; hence, they allow personalized treatment strategies that are guided by central clinical questions. However, despite the growing popularity of computational-modelling approaches in different stakeholder communities, there are still many hurdles to overcome for their clinical routine implementation in the future. Especially the integration of heterogeneous data from multiple sources and types are challenging tasks that require clear guidelines that also have to comply with high ethical and legal standards. Here, we discuss the most relevant computational models for personalized medicine in detail that can be considered as best-practice guidelines for application in clinical care.

	abstract = {Oscillatory processes are used throughout cell biology to control time-varying physiology including the cell cycle, circadian rhythms, and developmental patterning. It has long been understood that free-running oscillations require feedback loops where the activity of one component depends on the concentration of another. Oscillator motifs have been classified by the positive or negative net logic of these loops. However, each feedback loop can be implemented by regulation of either the production step or the removal step. These possibilities are not equivalent because of the underlying structure of biochemical kinetics. By computationally searching over these possibilities, we find that certain molecular implementations are much more likely to produce stable oscillations. These preferred molecular implementations are found in many natural systems, but not typically in artificial oscillators, suggesting a design principle for future synthetic biology. Finally, we develop an approach to oscillator function across different reaction networks by evaluating the biosynthetic cost needed to achieve a given phase coherence. This analysis predicts that phase drift is most efficiently suppressed by delayed negative feedback loop architectures that operate without positive feedback.

Robust parameterization of organism-level kinetic models that faithfully reproduce the effect of different genetic or environmental perturbations remains an open challenge due to the intractability of existing algorithms. This paper introduces K-FIT, a robust kinetic parameterization workflow that leverages a novel decomposition approach to identify steady-state fluxes in response to genetic perturbations followed by a gradient-based update of kinetic parameters until predictions simultaneously agree with the fluxomic data in all perturbed metabolic networks. The applicability of K-FIT to large-scale models is demonstrated by parameterizing an expanded kinetic model for E. coli (307 reactions and 258 metabolites) using fluxomic data from six mutants. The achieved thousand-fold speed-up afforded by K-FIT over meta-heuristic approaches is transformational enabling follow-up robustness of inference analyses and optimal design of experiments to inform metabolic engineering strategies.},

The k-ecoli457 model contains 457 model reactions, 337 metabolites and 295 substrate-level regulatory interactions. Parameterization is carried out using a genetic algorithm by simultaneously imposing all available fluxomic data (about 30 measured fluxes per mutant). The Pearson correlation coefficient between experimental data and predicted product yields for 320 engineered strains spanning 24 product metabolites is 0.84. This is substantially higher than that using flux balance analysis, minimization of metabolic adjustment or maximization of product yield exhibiting systematic errors with correlation coefficients of, respectively, 0.18, 0.37 and 0.47 (k-ecoli457 is available for download at http://www.maranasgroup.com).},

The situation can only be rectified when government agencies, universities and other research institutions change policies and that journals begin to insist that published work is in fact at least repeatable if not reproducible. In this chapter guidelines are described that can be used by researchers to help make sure their work is repeatable.

Sensitivity analysis can provide valuable insights about how robust the biological responses are with respect to the changes of biological parameters and which model inputs are the key factors that affect the model outputs. In addition, sensitivity analysis is valuable for guiding experimental analysis, model reduction and parameter estimation. Local and global sensitivity analysis approaches are the two types of sensitivity analysis that are commonly applied in systems biology. Local sensitivity analysis is a classic method that studies the impact of small perturbations on the model outputs. On the other hand, global sensitivity analysis approaches have been applied to understand how the model outputs are affected by large variations of the model input parameters. In this review, the author introduces the basic concepts of sensitivity analysis approaches applied to systems biology models.

Statistical approximations of parameter uncertainty may lead to dramatic errors in prediction uncertainty estimation. We argue that prediction uncertainty assessment must therefore be performed on a per-prediction basis using a full computational uncertainty analysis. In practice this is feasible by providing a model with a sample or ensemble representing the distribution of its parameters. Within a Bayesian framework, such a sample may be generated by a Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm that infers the parameter distribution based on experimental data.

We employ Gaussian process (GP) emulators to produce fast predictions about model behaviour at the arbitrary input parameter settings allowing output uncertainty distributions to be calculated. History matching identifies sets of input parameters that give rise to acceptable matches between observed data and model output given our representation of uncertainties. Modellers could proceed by simulating computer models’ outputs of interest at these identified parameter settings and producing a range of predictions. The variability in model results is crucial for inter-model comparison as well as model development. We illustrate the performance of emulation and history matching on a simple one-dimensional toy model and in application to a climate model.

	abstract = {Dynamical systems modeling, particularly via systems of ordinary differential equations, has been used to effectively capture the temporal behavior of different biochemical components in signal transduction networks. Despite the recent advances in experimental measurements, including sensor development and ‘-omics’ studies that have helped populate protein-protein interaction networks in great detail, modeling in systems biology lacks systematic methods to estimate kinetic parameters and quantify associated uncertainties. This is because of multiple reasons, including sparse and noisy experimental measurements, lack of detailed molecular mechanisms underlying the reactions, and missing biochemical interactions. Additionally, the inherent nonlinearities with respect to the states and parameters associated with the system of differential equations further compound the challenges of parameter estimation. In this study, we propose a comprehensive framework for Bayesian parameter estimation and complete quantification of the effects of uncertainties in the data and models. We apply these methods to a series of signaling models of increasing mathematical complexity. Systematic analysis of these dynamical systems showed that parameter estimation depends on data sparsity, noise level, and model structure, including the existence of multiple steady states. These results highlight how focused uncertainty quantification can enrich systems biology modeling and enable additional quantitative analyses for parameter estimation.},

	abstract = {Most biological models of intermediate size, and probably all large models, need to cope with the fact that many of their parameter values are unknown. In addition, it may not be possible to identify these values unambiguously on the basis of experimental data. This poses the question how reliable predictions made using such models are. Sensitivity analysis is commonly used to measure the impact of each model parameter on its variables. However, the results of such analyses can be dependent on an exact set of parameter values due to nonlinearity. To mitigate this problem, global sensitivity analysis techniques are used to calculate parameter sensitivities in a wider parameter space. We applied global sensitivity analysis to a selection of five signalling and metabolic models, several of which incorporate experimentally well-determined parameters. Assuming these models represent physiological reality, we explored how the results could change under increasing amounts of parameter uncertainty. Our results show that parameter sensitivities calculated with the physiological parameter values are not necessarily the most frequently observed under random sampling, even in a small interval around the physiological values. Often multimodal distributions were observed. Unsurprisingly, the range of possible sensitivity coefficient values increased with the level of parameter uncertainty, though the amount of parameter uncertainty at which the pattern of control was able to change differed among the models analysed. We suggest that this level of uncertainty can be used as a global measure of model robustness. Finally a comparison of different global sensitivity analysis techniques shows that, if high-throughput computing resources are available, then random sampling may actually be the most suitable technique.},

Results: This work introduces a freely downloadable, software package, SBML-SAT, which implements algorithms for simulation, steady state analysis, robustness analysis and local and global sensitivity analysis for SBML models. This software tool extends current capabilities through its execution of global sensitivity analyses using multi-parametric sensitivity analysis, partial rank correlation coefficient, SOBOL's method, and weighted average of local sensitivity analyses in addition to its ability to handle systems with discontinuous events and intuitive graphical user interface.
Conclusion: SBML-SAT provides the community of systems biologists a new tool for the analysis of their SBML models of biochemical and cellular processes.},

Sensitivity analysis can provide valuable insights about how robust the biological responses are with respect to the changes of biological parameters and which model inputs are the key factors that affect the model outputs. In addition, sensitivity analysis is valuable for guiding experimental analysis, model reduction and parameter estimation. Local and global sensitivity analysis approaches are the two types of sensitivity analysis that are commonly applied in systems biology. Local sensitivity analysis is a classic method that studies the impact of small perturbations on the model outputs. On the other hand, global sensitivity analysis approaches have been applied to understand how the model outputs are affected by large variations of the model input parameters. In this review, the author introduces the basic concepts of sensitivity analysis approaches applied to systems biology models. Moreover, the author discusses the advantages and disadvantages of different sensitivity analysis methods, how to choose a proper sensitivity analysis approach, the available sensitivity analysis tools for systems biology models and the caveats in the interpretation of sensitivity analysis results.},

	abstract = {This presentation aims to introduce global sensitivity analysis (SA), targeting an audience unfamiliar with the topic, and to give practical hints about the associated advantages and the effort needed. To this effect, we shall review some techniques for sensitivity analysis, including those that are not global, by applying them to a simple example. This will give the audience a chance to contrast each method’s result against the audience’s own expectation of what the sensitivity pattern for the simple model should be. We shall also try to relate the discourse on the relative importance of model input factors to specific questions, such as “Which of the uncertain input factor(s) is so noninfluential that we can safely fix it/them?” or “If we could eliminate the uncertainty in one of the input factors, which factor should we choose to reduce the most the variance of the output?” In this way, the selection of the method for sensitivity analysis will be put in relation to the framing of the analysis and to the interpretation and presentation of the results. The choice of the output of interest will be discussed in relation to the purpose of the model based analysis. The main methods that we present in this lecture are all related with one another, and are the method of Morris for factors’ screening and the variancebased measures. All are model-free, in the sense that their application does not rely on special assumptions on the behaviour of the model (such as linearity, monotonicity and additivity of the relationship between input factor and model output). Monte Carlo filtering will be also be discussed to demonstrate the usefulness of global sensitivity analysis in relation to estimation.},

Sensitivity analysis, aimed at ﬁnding model parameters whose changes yield signiﬁcantly altered cellular responses, is an important part of modeling work. However, sensitivity methods are often directly transplanted from analysis of technical systems, and thus, they may not serve the purposes of analysis of biological systems. This paper presents a novel sensitivity analysis method that is particularly suited to the task of searching for potential molecular drug targets in signaling pathways. Using two sample models of pathways, p53/Mdm2 regulatory module and IFN-β-induced JAK/STAT signaling pathway, we show that the method leads to biologically relevant conclusions, identifying processes suitable for targeted pharmacological inhibition, represented by the reduction of kinetic parameter values. That, in turn, facilitates subsequent search for active drug components.},

The case study, presented here, investigates interferon-gamma (IFNc) induced STAT1 signalling in two cell types that play a key role in pancreatic cancer development: pancreatic stellate and cancer cells. IFNc inhibits the growth for both types of cells and may be prototypic of agents that simultaneously hit cancer and stroma cells. We combined time-course experiments with mathematical modelling to focus on the common situation in which variations between profiles of experimental time series, from different cell types, are observed. To understand how biochemical reactions are causing the observed variations, we performed a parameter identifiability analysis. We successfully identified reactions that differ in pancreatic stellate cells and cancer cells, by comparing confidence intervals of parameter value estimates and the variability of model trajectories. Our analysis shows that useful information can also be obtained from nonidentifiable parameters. For the prediction of potential therapeutic targets we studied the consequences of uncertainty in the values of identifiable and nonidentifiable parameters. Interestingly, the sensitivity of model variables is robust against parameter variations and against differences between IFNc induced STAT1 signalling in pancreatic stellate and cancer cells. This provides the basis for a prediction of therapeutic targets that are valid for both cell types.},

While many sources of uncertainty may exist, they are generally categorized as either aleatory or epistemic. Uncertainties are characterized as epistemic, if the modeler sees a possibility to reduce them by gathering more data or by reﬁning models. Uncertainties are categorized as aleatory if the modeler does not foresee the possibility of reducing them. From a pragmatic standpoint, it is useful to thus categorize the uncertainties within a model, since it then becomes clear as to which uncertainties have the potential of being reduced. More importantly, epistemic uncertainties may introduce dependence among random events, which may not be properly noted if the character of uncertainties is not correctly modeled. Inﬂuences of the two types of uncertainties in reliability assessment, codiﬁed design, performance-based engineering and risk-based decision-making are discussed. Two simple examples demonstrate the inﬂuence of statistical dependence arising from epistemic uncertainties on systems and time-variant reliability problems.},

We test this claim through a series of ablation studies that demonstrate that each component is necessary to the system as a whole and to each other. What results is signiﬁcantly faster learning. NEAT is also an important contribution to GAs because it shows how it is possible for evolution to both optimize and complexify solutions simultaneously, offering the possibility of evolving increasingly complex solutions over generations, and strengthening the analogy with biological evolution.},

In this process, structural rewiring mutations are applied to the networks with inhibitory interactions between genes and the evolving networks are selected depending on whether, after a mutation, they closer approach the targeted dynamics. We show that, by using this method, networks with required oscillation periods, varying by up to three orders of magnitude, can be constructed by changing the architecture of regulatory connections between the genes.

	abstract = {Design and implementation of robust network modules is essential for construction of complex biological systems through hierarchical assembly of ‘parts’ and ‘devices’. The robustness of gene regulatory networks (GRNs) is ascribed chiefly to the underlying topology. The automatic designing capability of GRN topology that can exhibit robust behavior can dramatically change the current practice in synthetic biology. A recent study shows that Darwinian evolution can gradually develop higher topological robustness. Subsequently, this work presents an evolutionary algorithm that simulates natural evolution in silico, for identifying network topologies that are robust to perturbations. We present a Monte Carlo based method for quantifying topological robustness and designed a fitness approximation approach for efficient calculation of topological robustness which is computationally very intensive. The proposed framework was verified using two classic GRN behaviors: oscillation and bistability, although the framework is generalized for evolving other types of responses. The algorithm identified robust GRN architectures which were verified using different analysis and comparison. Analysis of the results also shed light on the relationship among robustness, cooperativity and complexity. This study also shows that nature has already evolved very robust architectures for its crucial systems; hence simulation of this natural process can be very valuable for designing robust biological systems.},

Second level determines the best estimate for the reaction rate constants for each of the reactions using a standard non-linear optimization algorithm. The process is repeated through a number of generations where the genetic algorithm will successively reduce the number of possibilities through elimination of poor CRNs (based on how closely the CRN is able to predict concentration profiles) and retaining and re-optimizing better CRNs. This system’s capability is demonstrated on an experimental data for the reaction between trimethyl orthoacetate and allyl alcohol. The results show that the system is able to develop a CRN that when simulated provides an accurate model (model predictions matching experimental measurements) with little human intervention.},

	abstract = {Discovering relations between chemical reaction networks (CRNs) is a relevant problem in computational systems biology for model reduction, to explain if a given system can be seen as an abstraction of another one; and for model comparison, useful to establish an evolutionary path from simpler networks to more complex ones. This is also related to foundational issues in computer science regarding program equivalence, in light of the established interpretation of a CRN as a kernel programming language for concurrency. Criteria for deciding if two CRNs can be formally related have been recently developed, but these require that a candidate mapping be provided. Automatically finding candidate mappings is very hard in general since the search space essentially consists of all possible partitions of a set. In this paper we tackle this problem by developing a genetic algorithm for a class of CRNs called influence networks, which can be used to model a variety of biological systems including cell-cycle switches and gene networks. An extensive numerical evaluation shows that our approach can successfully establish relations between influence networks from the literature which cannot be found by exact algorithms due to their large computational requirements.},

By systematically tuning the concentration of the inducers, salicylate and IPTG, the amplitude and period can be modulated independently. Furthermore, we constructed a quantitative model to forecast the regulation results. Under the guidance of the model, the expected oscillation can be regulated by choosing the proper concentration combinations of inducers. In summary, our work achieved independent control of the oscillator circuit, which allows the oscillator to be modularized and used in more complex circuit designs.},

Self-sustained oscillations are a ubiquitous and vital phenomenon in living systems. From primitive single-cellular bacteria to the most sophisticated organisms, periodicities have been observed in a broad spectrum of biological processes such as neuron firing, heart beats, cell cycles, circadian rhythms, etc. Defects in these oscillators can cause diseases from insomnia to cancer. Elucidating their fundamental mechanisms is of great significance to diseases, and yet challenging, due to the complexity and diversity of these oscillators.

Results
Approaches in quantitative systems biology and synthetic biology have been most effective by simplifying the systems to contain only the most essential regulators. Here, we will review major progress that has been made in understanding biological oscillators using these approaches. The quantitative systems biology approach allows for identification of the essential components of an oscillator in an endogenous system. The synthetic biology approach makes use of the knowledge to design the simplest, de novo oscillators in both live cells and cell-free systems. These synthetic oscillators are tractable to further detailed analysis and manipulations.

Conclusion
With the recent development of biological and computational tools, both approaches have made significant achievements.},

We demonstrate that differentiable optimisation, combined with proper regularisation, can discover non-trivial sparse reaction networks that can implement various sorts of oscillators and other chemical computing devices.},

We report here the bottom-up assembly of chemical systems that reproduce in vitro the specific dynamics of ecological communities. We experimentally observed unprecedented molecular behaviors, including predator–prey oscillations, competition-induced chaos, and symbiotic synchronization. These synthetic systems are tailored through a novel, compact, and versatile design strategy, leveraging the programmability of DNA interactions under the precise control of enzymatic catalysis.

              Due to the variety and importance of roles performed by signalling networks, understanding their function and evolution is of great interest. Signalling networks allow organisms to process and react to changes in their internal and external environment. Current estimates suggest that two to three percent of all genomes code for proteins involved in signalling networks. The study of signalling networks is hindered by the complexities of the networks and difficulties in ascribing function to form. For example, a very complex dense network might comprise eighty or more densely connected proteins. In the majority of cases there is very little understanding of how these networks process signals. Unlike in electronics, where there is a broad practical and theoretical understanding of how to construct devices that can process almost any kind of signal, in biological signalling networks there is no equivalent theory. Part of the problem stems from the fact that in most cases it is unknown what particular signal processing circuits would look like in a biological form. This paper describes the evolutionary methods used to generate networks with particular signal‐ and computational‐processing capabilities. The techniques involved are described, and the approach is illustrated by evolving computational circuits such as multiplication, radicals and logarithmic functions. The experiments also illustrate the evolution of modularity within biochemical reaction networks.},

However, it is so far unclear how evolution has shaped these motifs based on elementary biochemical reactions. This paper presents a method of designing important dynamics such as bistability and oscillation with these network motifs using an artiﬁcial evolutionary algorithm. The evolved dynamics of the network motifs are then veriﬁed when the initial states and the parameters of the network motifs are perturbed. It has been found that while it is straightforward to evolve the switching behavior, it is difﬁcult to evolve stable oscillatory dynamics. We show that a higher Hill coefﬁcient will facilitate the generation of undamped oscillation, however, an evolutionary path that can lead to a high Hill coefﬁcient remains an open question for future research.},

The evolutionary algorithm evolves model structures by combining different modules taken from a predefined module library and then it fine-tunes the associated stochastic kinetic constants. We investigate four alternative objective functions for the fitness calculation within the evolutionary algorithm: (1) equally weighted sum method, (2) normalization method, (3) randomly weighted sum method, and (4) equally weighted product method. The effectiveness of the methodology is tested on four case studies of increasing complexity including negative and positive autoregulation as well as two gene networks implementing a pulse generator and a bandwidth detector.

However, determining minimal GRNs that produce desired time-series behaviors is non-trivial. In this paper, we propose a ‘top-down’ approach to evolving small GRNs and then use these to recursively boot-strap the identification of larger, more complex, modular GRNs. We start with relatively dense GRNs and then use differential evolution (DE) to evolve interaction coefficients. When the target dynamical behavior is found embedded in a dense GRN, we narrow the focus of the search and begin aggressively pruning out excess interactions at the end of each generation. We first show that the method can quickly rediscover known small GRNs for a toggle switch and an oscillatory circuit. Next we include these GRNs as non-evolvable subnetworks in the subsequent evolution of more complex, modular GRNs. Successful solutions found in canonical DE where we truncated small interactions to zero, with or without an interaction penalty term, invariably contained many excess interactions. In contrast, by incorporating aggressive pruning and the penalty term, the DE was able to find minimal or nearly minimal GRNs in all test problems.},

The main objective of our work is to develop a theoretical approach which will help to better understand the behavior of signal transduction networks due to changes in kinetic parameters and network topology. By using an evolutionary algorithm, we designed a mathematical model which performs basic signaling tasks similar to the signaling process of living cells. We use a simple dynamical model of signaling networks of interacting proteins and their complexes. We study the evolution of signaling networks described by mass-action kinetics. The fitness of the networks is determined by the number of signals detected out of a series of signals with varying strength. The mutations include changes in the reaction rate and network topology. We found that stronger interactions and addition of new nodes lead to improved evolved responses. The strength of the signal does not play any role in determining the response type. This model will help to understand the dynamic behavior of the proteins involved in signaling pathways. It will also help to understand the robustness of the kinetics of the output response upon changes in the rate of reactions and the topology of the network.},

	abstract = {Evolved gene networks are constrained by natural selection. Their structures and functions are consequently far from being random, as exemplified by the multiple instances of parallel/convergent evolution. One can thus ask if features of actual gene networks can be recovered from evolutionary first principles. I review a method for in silico evolution of small models of gene networks aiming at performing predefined biological functions. I summarize the current implementation of the algorithm, insisting on the construction of a proper “fitness” function. I illustrate the approach on three examples: biochemical adaptation, ligand discrimination and vertebrate segmentation (somitogenesis). While the structure of the evolved networks is variable, dynamics of our evolved networks are usually constrained and present many similar features to actual gene networks, including properties that were not explicitly selected for. In silico evolution can thus be used to predict biological behaviours without a detailed knowledge of the mapping between genotype and phenotype.},

	abstract = {Simulated evolution of biological networks can be used to generate functional networks as well as investigate hypotheses regarding natural evolution. A handful of studies have shown how simulated evolution can be used for studying the functional space spanned by biochemical networks, studying natural evolution, or designing new synthetic networks. If there was a method for easily performing such studies, it can allow the community to further experiment with simulated evolution and explore all of its uses. As a result, we have developed a library written in the C language that performs all the basic functions needed to carry out simulated evolution of biological networks. The library comes with a generic genetic algorithm as well as genetic algorithms for specifically evolving genetic networks, protein networks, or mass-action networks. The library also comes with functions for simulating these networks. A user needs to specify a desired function. A GUI is provided for users to become oriented with all the options available in the library. The library is free and open source under the BSD lisence and can be obtained at evolvenetworks.sourceforge.net. It can be built on all major platforms. The code can be most conveniently compiled using cross-platform make (CMake).},

	abstract = {The use of digital twins (DTs) has proliferated across various fields and industries, with a recent surge in the healthcare sector. The concept of digital twin for health (DT4H) holds great promise to revolutionize the entire healthcare system, including management and delivery, disease treatment and prevention, and health well-being maintenance, ultimately improving human life. The rapid growth of big data and continuous advancement in data science (DS) and artificial intelligence (AI) have the potential to significantly expedite DT research and development by providing scientific expertise, essential data, and robust cybertechnology infrastructure. Although various DT initiatives have been underway in the industry, government, and military, DT4H is still in its early stages. This paper presents an overview of the current applications of DTs in healthcare, examines consortium research centers and their limitations, and surveys the current landscape of emerging research and development opportunities in healthcare. We envision the emergence of a collaborative global effort among stakeholders to enhance healthcare and improve the quality of life for millions of individuals worldwide through pioneering research and development in the realm of DT technology.},

            From purely theoretical considerations Lotka (1920) and Volterra (1926) concluded that a biological system consisting of two interdependent species (predator and prey) will exhibit regular periodic fluctuations in respect to the absolute and relative abundance of each species, even when random fluctuations due to external environmental factors have been eliminated. So far as is known this conclusion has not been investigated by direct experimental methods.},

However, it is so far unclear how evolution has shaped these motifs based on elementary biochemical reactions. This paper presents a method of designing important dynamics such as bistability and oscillation with these network motifs using an artiﬁcial evolutionary algorithm. The evolved dynamics of the network motifs are then veriﬁed when the initial states and the parameters of the network motifs are perturbed. It has been found that while it is straightforward to evolve the switching behavior, it is difﬁcult to evolve stable oscillatory dynamics. We show that a higher Hill coefﬁcient will facilitate the generation of undamped oscillation, however, an evolutionary path that can lead to a high Hill coefﬁcient remains an open question for future research.},

	abstract = {One goal of synthetic biology is to implement useful functions with biochemical reactions, either by reprogramming living cells or programming artiﬁcial vesicles. In this perspective, we consider Chemical Reaction Networks (CRN) as a programming language, and investigate the CRN program synthesis problem. Recent work has shown that CRN interpreted by diﬀerential equations are Turing-complete and can be seen as analog computers where the molecular concentrations play the role of information carriers. Any real function that is computable by a Turing machine in arbitrary precision can thus be computed by a CRN over a ﬁnite set of molecular species. The proof of this result gives a numerical method to generate a ﬁnite CRN for implementing a real function presented as the solution of a Polynomial Initial Values Problem (PIVP). In this paper, we study an alternative method based on artiﬁcial evolution to build a CRN that approximates a real function given on ﬁnite sets of input values. We present a nested search algorithm that evolves the structure of the CRN and optimizes the kinetic parameters at each generation. We evaluate this algorithm on the Heaviside and Cosine functions both as functions of time and functions of input molecular species. We then compare the CRN obtained by artiﬁcial evolution both to the CRN generated by the numerical method from a PIVP deﬁnition of the function, and to the natural CRN found in the BioModels repository for switches and oscillators.},

	abstract = {Discovering relations between chemical reaction networks (CRNs) is a relevant problem in computational systems biology for model reduction, to explain if a given system can be seen as an abstraction of another one; and for model comparison, useful to establish an evolutionary path from simpler networks to more complex ones. This is also related to foundational issues in computer science regarding program equivalence, in light of the established interpretation of a CRN as a kernel programming language for concurrency. Criteria for deciding if two CRNs can be formally related have been recently developed, but these require that a candidate mapping be provided. Automatically finding candidate mappings is very hard in general since the search space essentially consists of all possible partitions of a set. In this paper we tackle this problem by developing a genetic algorithm for a class of CRNs called influence networks, which can be used to model a variety of biological systems including cell-cycle switches and gene networks. An extensive numerical evaluation shows that our approach can successfully establish relations between influence networks from the literature which cannot be found by exact algorithms due to their large computational requirements.},
